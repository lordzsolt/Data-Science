Any Shareholder receiving a certificate shall indemnify and hold the Company and its directors and
officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or
fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the possession thereof. If a certificate for
Shares is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate or on satisfactory
proof of its loss together with such indemnity as may be required by Resolution of Directors.

If several Persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, any one of such Persons may give an
effectual receipt for any Distribution.

SHARES
Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.

Prior to Admission, Shares and other Securities may be issued at such times, to such Persons, for such
consideration and on such terms as the directors may by Resolution of Directors determine.

Following Admission, and subject to a Special Resolution, the directors shall be authorised within any
one period of twelve months or the period between consecutive annual general meetings to allot any
further number of Shares on such terms as they shall in their discretion determine up to such maximum
number as representing 50 per cent of the number of Shares as was in issue at the commencement of that
period and they shall be authorised to allow any further number of Shares on such terms as they shall in
their discretion determine but subject to the passing of a Special Resolution.

In so far as the provision of Sub-Regulation 2.2 apply, such provisions shall not apply to the allotment of
any Shares for a consideration other than cash, or to the allotment of any Shares to an employee share
scheme.

Shares shall be at the disposal of the directors and (save as otherwise directed by these Articles or by
Special Resolution) they may allot, grant options or warrants over or otherwise dispose of them to such
persons at such times and generally on such terms and conditions as they think proper.

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note, or other
written obligation to contribute money or property, real property, personal property (including goodwill
and know-how), services rendered or a contract for future services.

No Shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of Directors has been
passed stating:

(a) the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares;

(b) the determination of the directors of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money
consideration for the issue; and

(c) that, in the opinion of the directors, the present cash value of the non-money consideration for the
issue is not less than the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares.

The consideration paid for any Share, whether a par value Share or a no par value Share, shall not be
treated as a liability or debt of the Company for the purposes of:

(a) the solvency test in Regulations 3 and 18; and

(b) sections 197 and 209 of the Act.

The Company shall keep a register (the “register of members”) containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the Persons who hold Shares;

(b) the number of each class and series of Shares held by each Shareholder;

(c) the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the register of members; and
(d) the date on which any Person ceased to be a Shareholder.

The register of members may be in any such form as the directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic,
electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its
contents. Until the directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form shall
be the original register of members.

A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the register of members.

Nothing in these Articles shall require title to any shares or other securities of the Company to be
evidenced by a certificate if the Act and the rules of the Stock Exchange permit otherwise.

Subject to the Act and the rules of the Stock Exchange, the Board without further consultation with the
holders of any Shares or securities of the Company may resolve that any class or series of Shares or other
securities of the Company from time to time in issue or to be issued (including shares in issue at the date
of the adoption of these Articles) may be issued, held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise
dealt with in uncertificated form in accordance with the Securities Regulations and practices instituted by
the operator of the relevant system and no provision of these Articles will apply to any uncertificated
share or other securities in uncertificated form or the transfer of title to any such shares or other securities
by means of a relevant system or any provision of the Securities Regulations.

Conversion of Shares held in certificated form into Shares held in uncertificated form, and vice versa, may
be made in such manner as the Board may, in its absolute discretion, thinks fit (subject always to the
Securities Regulations and the requirements of the relevant system concerned). The Company shall enter
on the register of members the number of Shares held by each Shareholder in uncertificated from and in
certificated form and shall maintain the register of members in each case as is required by the Securities
Regulations and the relevant system concerned. Notwithstanding any provision of these Articles, a class
or series comprising both certificated Shares and uncertificated Shares or as a result of any provision of
these Articles or the Securities Regulations which apply on in respect of the certificated or uncertificated
Shares.

If a share certificate for certificated Shares is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed it may be replaced
without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and to payment of any exceptional
out-of-pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity as

the Company.

All forms of certificate for share or loan capital or other securities of the Company (other than letters of
allotment, scrip certificates and other like documents) shall be issued under the Seal or in such other
manner as the Board may authorise. The Board may by Resolution of Directors determine, either
generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures on any such certificate need not be
autographic but may be affixed to such certificate by some mechanical or electronic means or may be
printed thereon or that such certificate need not be signed by any person.

Any Shareholder receiving a share certificate for certificated Shares shall indemnify and hold the
Company and its Directors and officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by
reason by virtue of the possession thereof.

REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own Shares save that the Company
may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent of Shareholders whose
Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the Company is permitted by the Act
or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire the
Shares without their consent.

The Company may only offer to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Shares if the Resolution of
Directors authorising the purchase, redemption or other acquisition contains a statement that the directors
are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the acquisition the value of the Company’s
assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Sections 60 (Process for acquisition of own Shares), 61 (Offer to one or more shareholders) and 62
(Shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of company) of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to this Regulation may be
cancelled or held as Treasury Shares except to the extent that such Shares are in excess of 50 percent of
the issued Shares in which case they shall be cancelled but they shall be available for reissue.

All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be exercised by the
Company while it holds the Share as a Treasury Share.

Treasury Shares may be transferred by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise
inconsistent with the Memorandum and the Articles) as the Company may by Resolution of Directors
determine.

Where Shares are held by another body corporate of which the Company holds, directly or indirectly,
Shares having more than 50 percent of the votes in the election of directors of the other body corporate, all

FORFEITURE

Shares whose issue price are not fully paid on issue are subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in this
Regulation and for this purpose Shares issued for a promissory note, other written obligation to contribute
money or property or a contract for future services are deemed to be not fully paid.

A written notice of call specifying the date for payment to be made shall be served on the Shareholder who
defaults in making payment in respect of the Shares.

The written notice of call referred to in Sub-Regulation 5.2 shall name a further date not earlier than the
expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice on or before which the payment required by the
notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before the time
named in the notice the Shares, or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be liable to
be forfeited.

Where a written notice of call has been issued pursuant to Sub-Regulation 5.3 and the requirements of the
notice have not been complied with, the directors may, at any time before tender of payment, forfeit and
cancel the Shares to which the notice relates.

The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to a Shareholder whose Shares have been
cancelled pursuant to Sub-Regulation 5.4 and that Shareholder shall be discharged from any further
obligation to the Company.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Subject to any limitations in the Memorandum, certificated Shares may be transferred by a written
instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee,
which shall be sent to the Company for registration.

In the case of uncertificated Shares, a Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer his Shares by means of a
relevant system and the operator of the relevant system shall act as agent of the Shareholders for the
purposes of the transfer of Shares. In addition to the foregoing, a transferor of uncertificated Shares is
effective only if a record of the transfer evidencing the transferor’s consent is available and the statutory
particulars in respect of the transferee are entered in the register of members.

The transferor of any Shares shall remain the holder of those Shares until the name of the transferee is
entered in the register as the holder of those Shares.

The register of members may be closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to
time determine, not exceeding in aggregate thirty days in each year, upon notice being given by
advertisement in a leading daily newspaper and in such other newspaper (if any) as may be required by the
Act and the practice of the Stock Exchange.

(a) any written instrument of transfer, duly stamped (if so required), is lodged within the Company
at the registered office or such other place as the Board may appoint accompanied by the
certificate for the Shares to which it relates (except in the case of a transfer by a recognized
person or a holder of such Shares in respect of whom the Company is not required by law to
deliver a certificate and to whom a certificate has not been issued in respect of such Shares);

(b) any instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class or series of Share; and

(c) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the Share is to be

the person lodging it when the notice of refusal is given.

If the Board declines to register a transfer it shall, within two months or such other period (if any) as may
be prescribed by the Act, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any transfer, probate, letters of administration,
certificate of death or marriage, power of attorney, distringas or stop notice, order of court or other
instrument relating to or affecting the title of any Share, or otherwise making any entry in the Register
relating to any Share.

The executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder, the guardian of an incompetent member or the
trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title
to his Share but they shall not be entitled to exercise any rights as a Shareholder of the Company until they
have proceeded as set forth in the next following three Regulations.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters of
administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased Shareholder or of the appointment
of a guardian of any incompetent Shareholder or the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder shall be accepted

British Virgin Islands if the document evidencing the grant of probate or letters of administration,
confirmation as executor, appointment as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy is issued by a foreign court
which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign
court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the Directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The
Directors may also require an indemnity to be given by the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in
bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in consequence of
death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered as a Shareholder upon such
evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Directors and in the case of uncertificated
Shares subject also to the facilities and requirements of the relevant system concerned. An application by
any such person to be registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transfer of
Shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and the Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or
bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself, request in writing that some
person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such Share or Shares and such request shall
likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court having
regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

The transfer of a Share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of members.

If the directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has been
signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of Directors:

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the
absence of the instrument of transfer.

Subject to the Memorandum, the personal representative of a deceased Shareholder may transfer a Share
even though the personal representative is not a Shareholder at the time of the transfer.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The board shall convene and the Company shall hold annual general meetings at least once in each
calendar year.

Subject to the requirements of the Act, and Article 7.1, any director of the Company may convene
meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British
Virgin Islands as the director considers necessary or desirable.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 30 percent or more of the voting rights in
respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting of
Shareholders.

At least 21 clear days’ notice shall be given for every annual general meeting of the Shareholders and at
least 14 clear days’ notice for general meetings of Shareholders. Notices of Shareholder meetings shall be
sent to:

(a) those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the
register of members and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and

(b) the other directors.

The director convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining those
Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other
date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if Shareholders
holding at least 90 percent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have
waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the meeting shall
constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure of a director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder
or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not received notice, does not
invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on
behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting before the
time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The notice
of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or time at which the proxy shall be presented.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following form or such other form as the
chairman of the meeting shall accept as properly evidencing the wishes of the Shareholder appointing the

proxy.

7.16

7.17

(a) if two or more persons hold Shares jointly each of them may be present in person or by proxy at
a meeting of Shareholders and may speak as a Shareholder;

(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf of all joint
owners; and

(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one.

A Shareholder shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of Shareholders if he participates by telephone
or other electronic means and all Shareholders participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A meeting of Shareholders is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there are present in
person or by proxy Shareholders holding not less than two Shares entitled to vote on resolutions of
Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single Shareholder or proxy and
then such person may pass a resolution of Shareholders and a certificate signed by such person
accompanied where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid
resolution of the Shareholder.

If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if
convened upon the requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand
adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting was to have been held at the
same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned
meeting there are present within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy
not less than one third of the votes of the Shares or each class or series of Shares entitled to vote on the
matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting
shall be dissolved.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the meeting. If
there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present at the meeting, the
Shareholders present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman. If the Shareholders are unable
to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest number of voting Shares
present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as chairman failing which the oldest individual
Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from
place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left
unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he
considers appropriate whether any resolution proposed has been carried or not and the result of his
decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting. If the chairman

has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken of all
votes cast upon such resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present in person
or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may immediately
following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken.
If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes
of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives of
Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a Shareholder shall be
determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which, the Person is constituted
or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the directors may in good faith seek legal advice from any
qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the directors
may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the Company.

Any Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other
governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of
Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be entitled to exercise
the same rights on behalf of the Shareholder which he represents as that Shareholder could exercise if it
were an individual.

The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Person other than an
individual may call for a notarially certified copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced
within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such Person shall be
disregarded.

Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

An action that may be taken by the Shareholders at a meeting may also be taken by a resolution consented
to in writing, without the need for any notice, but if any resolution of the Shareholders is adopted
otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall
forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the form of
counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the earliest
date upon which Shareholders holding a sufficient number of votes of Shares to constitute a resolution of
the Shareholders have consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

DIRECTORS

The first directors of the Company shall be appointed by the first registered agent within 6 months of the
date of incorporation of the Company; and thereafter, the directors shall be elected by Ordinary
Resolution or by Resolution of Directors.

No person shall be appointed as a director, alternate director, or nominated as a reserve director, of the
Company unless he has consented in writing to be a director, alternate director or to be nominated as a
reserve director respectively.

Subject to Sub-Regulation 8.1, the minimum number of directors shall be one and there shall be no
maximum number.

Each director holds office for the term, if any, fixed by the Ordinary Resolution or the Resolution of
Directors appointing him, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If no term is fixed on the
appointment of a director, the director serves indefinitely until his earlier death, resignation or removal.

The following provisions in relation to the retirement of directors by rotation shall apply:
a) at each annual general meeting one-third of the directors for the time being (or, if their number is

not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not more than one-third) shall retire from office
by rotation;

b) the directors to retire in every year shall be those subject to retirement by rotation who have been
longest in office since their last re-election or appointment. As between persons who become or
were last re-elected directors on the same day, those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree
among themselves) be determined by lot. A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election;

Cc) the Company at the annual general meeting at which a director retires under any provision of
these Articles may by Ordinary Resolution fill the office being vacated by electing thereto the
retiring director or some other person eligible for appointment. In default, the retiring director
shall be deemed to have been re-elected except in any of the following cases: (i) where at such
annual general meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such office or a resolution for the
re-election of such director is put to the meeting and lost; (11) where such director is disqualified
under the Act from holding office as a director or has given notice in writing to the Company that
he is unwilling to be re-elected; or (iii) where such director has attained any retiring age
applicable to him as a director; and

d) the retirement shall not have effect until the conclusion of the annual general meeting except
where a resolution is passed to elect some other person in the place of the retiring director or a
resolution for his re-election is put to the annual general meeting and lost and according a retiring
director who is re-elected or deemed to have been re-elected in office without a break.

A director may be removed from office,

(a) with or without cause, by Special Resolution passed at a meeting of Shareholders called for the
purposes of removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director;

(b) a registered medical practitioner who is treating the director gives a written opinion to the
Company stating that the person has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as a
director and may remain so for more than three months;

(c) by reasons of that director’s mental health, a court make an order which wholly or partly prevents
that person from personally exercising any powers or rights which that person would otherwise
have; or

(d) with cause, by Resolution of Directors passed at a meeting of directors called for the purpose of

removing the director or for purposes including the removal of the director.

A director may resign his office by giving written notice of his resignation to the Company and the
resignation has effect from the date the notice is received by the Company or from such later date as may
be specified in the notice. A director shall resign forthwith as a director if he is, or becomes, disqualified
from acting as a director under the Act.

The directors may at any time appoint any person to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an addition
to the existing directors. Where the directors appoint a person as director to fill a vacancy, the term shall
not exceed the term that remained when the person who has ceased to be a director ceased to hold office.

A vacancy in relation to directors occurs if a director dies or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to the
expiration of his term of office.

Where the Company only has one Shareholder who is an individual and that Shareholder is also the sole
director of the Company, the sole Shareholder/director may, by instrument in writing, nominate a person
who is not disqualified from being a director of the Company as a reserve director of the Company to act
in the place of the sole director in the event of his death.

The nomination of a person as a reserve director of the Company ceases to have effect if:

(a) before the death of the sole Shareholder/director who nominated him
(i) he resigns as reserve director, or
(ii) the sole Shareholder/director revokes the nomination in writing; or

BVIPTEBC 2013/01/45(NPVNOC) SPECIAL -15-
8.17

8.19

8.20

(b) the sole Shareholder/director who nominated him ceases to be able to be the sole
Shareholder/director of the Company for any reason other than his death.

The Company shall keep a register of directors containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the persons who are directors of the Company or who have been
nominated as reserve directors of the Company;

(b) the date on which each person whose name is entered in the register was appointed as a director,
or nominated as a reserve director, of the Company;

(c) the date on which each person named as a director ceased to be a director of the Company;

(d) the date on which the nomination of any person nominated as a reserve director ceased to have
effect; and

(e) such other information as may be prescribed by the Act.

The register of directors may be kept in any such form as the directors may approve, but if it is in
magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of
its contents. Until a Resolution of Directors determining otherwise is passed, the magnetic, electronic or
other data storage shall be the original register of directors.

The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, fix the emoluments of directors with respect to services to
be rendered in any capacity to the Company.

A director is not required to hold a Share as a qualification to office.

A director, by written instrument deposited at the registered office of the Company may from time to time
appoint another director or another person who is not disqualified for appointment as a director under
section 111 of the Act to be his alternate to:

(a) exercise the appointing director's powers; and
(b) carry out the appointing director's responsibilities,
in relation to the taking of decisions by the directors in the absence of the appointing director.

No person shall be appointed as an alternate director unless he has consented in writing to be an alternate
director. The appointment of an alternate director does not take effect until written notice of the
appointment has been deposited at the registered office of the Company.

The appointing director may, at any time, terminate or vary the alternate's appointment. The termination
or variation of the appointment of an alternate director does not take effect until written notice of the
termination or variation has been deposited at the registered office of the Company, save that if a director
shall die or cease to hold the office of director, the appointment of his alternate shall thereupon cease and
terminate immediately without the need of notice.

An alternate director has no power to appoint an alternate, whether of the appointing director or of the
alternate director.

An alternate director has the same rights as the appointing director in relation to any directors' meeting
and any written resolution of directors circulated for written consent. Unless stated otherwise in the
notice of the appointment of the alternate, or a notice of variation of the appointment, if undue delay or
difficulty would be occasioned by giving notice to a director of a resolution of which his approval is
sought in accordance with these Articles his alternate (if any) shall be entitled to signify approval of the
same on behalf of that director. Any exercise by the alternate director of the appointing director's powers
in relation to the taking of decisions by the directors is as effective as if the powers were exercised by the
appointing director. An alternate director does not act as an agent of or for the appointing director and is
liable for his own acts and omissions as an alternate director.

POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of, the
directors of the Company. The directors of the Company have all the powers necessary for managing, and
for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The directors may pay all
expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the Company and may
exercise all such powers of the Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or the Articles
required to be exercised by the Shareholders.

Each director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company
acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each director, in exercising
his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the director believes to be
the best interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company may,
when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, act in a manner which he believes is in the best
interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised representative
for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the directors, with respect to the signing of consents or
otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of the
Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts
for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the
case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution of Directors.

For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the directors may by Resolution of
Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition is in the usual or regular
course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of fraud,
conclusive.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to each
other director.

The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and
places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary or
desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or other
electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of directors
held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors entitled to
vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a
director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a
meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the
meeting.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there are
present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of directors, unless there are
only 2 directors in which case the quorum is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of directors do not
apply and such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not
by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu of
minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence
of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of the
meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the directors
present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken by
a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors consented to in writing or by telex,
telegram, cable or other written electronic communication by a majority of the directors or by a majority
of the members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice. A written
resolution consented to in such manner may consist of several documents, including written electronic
communication, in like form each signed or assented to by one or more directors. If the consent is in one
or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the
date upon which the last director has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

COMMITTEES
The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of one
or more directors, and delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal, to the

committee.

The directors have no power to delegate to a committee of directors any of the following powers:

(a) to amend the Memorandum or the Articles;

(b) to designate committees of directors;

(c) to delegate powers to a committee of directors;

(d) to appoint or remove directors;

(e) to appoint or remove an agent;

(f) to approve a plan of merger, consolidation or arrangement;

(g) to make a declaration of solvency or to approve a liquidation plan; or

(h) to make a determination that immediately after a proposed Distribution the value of the
Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they
fall due.

Sub-Regulation 11.2(b) and (c) do not prevent a committee of directors, where authorised by the
Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from
appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of 2 or more directors shall be
governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far
as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors establishing the
committee.

Where the directors delegate their powers to a committee of directors they remain responsible for the
exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times before

OFFICERS AND AGENTS

The Company may by Resolution of Directors appoint officers of the Company at such times as may be
considered necessary or expedient. Such officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board of Directors, a
president and one or more vice-presidents, secretaries and treasurers and such other officers as may from
time to time be considered necessary or expedient. Any number of offices may be held by the same
person.

The officers shall perform such duties as are prescribed at the time of their appointment subject to any
modification in such duties as may be prescribed thereafter by Resolution of Directors. In the absence of
any specific prescription of duties it shall be the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board to preside at
meetings of directors and Shareholders, the president to manage the day to day affairs of the Company,
the vice-presidents to act in order of seniority in the absence of the president but otherwise to perform
such duties as may be delegated to them by the president, the secretaries to maintain the register of
members, minute books and records (other than financial records) of the Company and to ensure
compliance with all procedural requirements imposed on the Company by applicable law, and the
treasurer to be responsible for the financial affairs of the Company.

The emoluments of all officers shall be fixed by Resolution of Directors.

The officers of the Company shall hold office until their successors are duly appointed, but any officer

Directors. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by Resolution of Directors.

The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, appoint any person, including a person who is a director, to
be an agent of the Company.

(k) to authorise the Company to continue as a company incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction

on him.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

A Conflicted Director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of a Relevant Situation,
disclose the Relevant Situation to all other directors of the Company. Subject to the Act, the directors
may authorise any Relevant Situation (including without limitation, the continuing performance by the

Save as authorised under this Sub-Regulation 13.4, a director shall not vote on or be counted in the
quorum in relation to any Resolution of Directors or of a committee of the directors concerning any

fixing or varying the terms of appointment or termination) of two or more directors to offices or places of

divided and a separate resolution considered in relation to each director. In such case each of the directors
concerned (if not otherwise debarred from voting under these Articles) shall be entitled to vote (and be
counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own appointment.

If any question arises at any meeting of the directors or any committee of the directors as to whether an

counted in a quorum and such question is not resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting
or being counted in the quorum such question (unless the director concerned is the Chairman in which
case Sub-Regulation 13.7 shall apply) shall before the conclusion of the meeting be referred to the

conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of the interest of the director has not been fairly
disclosed.

voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting or being counted in the quorum, such question shall before the
conclusion of the meeting be decided by Resolution of Directors or committee members present at the

incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who:

view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no
reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

the best interests of

(a) the Company’s holding company; or
(b) a Shareholder or Shareholders;
in either case, in the circumstances specified in Sub-Regulation 9.3 or the Act, as the case may be.

The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to
the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles, unless a
question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a
nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good
faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that the director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance
with Sub-Regulation 14.1.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former director to repay the amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that the former director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in
accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems
appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section is not
exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any agreement, resolution of Shareholders, resolution of disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as acting in the person’s official capacity and as to acting in another capacity while
serving as a director of the Company.

If a person referred to in Sub-Regulation 14.1 has been successful in defence of any proceedings referred
to in Sub-Regulation 14.1, the person is entitled to be indemnified against all expenses, including legal
fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by the
person in connection with the proceedings.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a director,
officer or liquidator of the Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director,
officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company or a partnership,

person against the liability as provided in the Articles.

Except with the consent of the Board, when:

(a) any person acquires, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, Shares
which (taken together with Shares held or acquired by persons acting in concert with him) carry
30% or more of the voting rights of the Company; or

(b) any person who, together with persons acting in concert with him, holds not less than 30% but
not more than 50% of the voting rights and such person, or any person acting in concert with him,
acquires additional Shares which increase his percentage of the voting rights;

such person (the “offeror’’) shall extend an offer on the basis set out in this Regulation 23, to the holders
of all the issued shares in the Company.

Any offer made under this Regulation must be conditional only upon the offeror having received
acceptances in respect of Shares which together with Shares acquired or agreed to be acquired before or
during the offer, will result in the offeror and any person acting in concert with it holding Shares carrying
more than 50% of the voting rights.

No acquisition of Shares which would give rise to a requirement for any offer under this Regulation may
be made or registered if the making or implementation of such offer would or might be dependent on the
passing of a resolution at any meeting of Shareholders of the Company or upon any other conditions,
consents or arrangements.

Offers made under this Regulation must, in respect of each class of Share capital involved, be in cash or be
accompanied by a cash alternative at not less than the highest price paid by the offeror or any person
acting in concert with it for Shares of that class during the offer period and within 12 months prior to its
commencement. The cash offer or the cash alternative must remain open after the offer has become or is

otherwise have expired.

No nominee of an offeror or persons acting in concert with it may be appointed as a Director, nor may an
offeror and persons acting in concert with it exercise the votes attaching to any Shares held in the
Company until the offer document has been posted.

Any offer required to be made pursuant to this Regulation 23 shall be made on terms that would be
required by the then current United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the “City Code”),
save to the extent that the board otherwise determines. In relation to any offer required to be made
pursuant to this Regulation 23, any matter which under the City Code would fall to be determined by the
Panel shall be determined by the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board
to make such determination.

Except with the consent of the Board, Shareholders shall comply with the requirements of the City Code,
as may from time to time be published by the United Kingdom Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the
“Panel’”), in relation to any dealings in any Shares of the Company and in relation to their dealings with
the Company in relation to all matters. Any matter which under the City Code would fall to be determined
by the Panel shall be determined by the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the
Board to make such determination. Any notice which under the City Code is required to be given to the
Panel or any person (other than the Company) shall be given to the Company at its registered office.

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Shareholder having incurred an obligation under this
Regulation 23 to extend an offer to the holders of all the issued Shares shall have failed so to do, or that
any Shareholders is in default of any other obligation imposed upon Shareholders pursuant to this
Regulation 23, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a “direction
notice”) to such Shareholders and any other Shareholders acting in concert with such Shareholders
(together the “defaulters”) direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares held by the defaulters (the “default shares”) the defaulters shall not be
entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy or to exercise any other right
conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the Company;

(b) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due from the
Company on the default shares, whether in respect of capital or dividend or otherwise, and the
Company shall not meet any liability to pay interest on any such payment when it is finally paid
to the Shareholders;

(c) no other distribution shall be made on the default shares.
The Board may at any time give notice cancelling a direction notice.

In constructing this Regulation 23, words and expressions used in or defined in the City Code shall bear
the same meaning as given by the City Code.

DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN SHARES AND FAILURE TO DISCLOSE

Qualifying Financial Instruments (or a combination of such holdings):

(a) reaches, exceeds or falls below 3 per cent and each 1 per cent threshold thereafter up to 100 per

Service.

At the end of each calendar month during which an increase or decrease has occurred, the Company must

(a) the total number of voting rights in respect of each class of Share which it issues; and
(b) the total number of voting rights attaching to Shares of the Company which are held by it in
treasury.

In the event that the total number of voting rights in respect of any class of Shares issued by the Company
increases or decreases by | per cent or more following completion of a transaction by the Company, then,
notwithstanding Regulation 24.3, the Company must notify a Regulatory Information Service without
delay.

A notification given by (i) a person to the Company in accordance with Regulation 24.1 or (ii) the
Company to a Regulatory Information Service in accordance with Regulations 24.2 to 24.4 (inclusive),
shall include the following information:

(a) the resulting situation in terms of voting rights and the date on which the relevant Threshold was
reached or crossed;

(b) if applicable, the chain of controlled undertakings through which voting rights are effectively

(f) any other information required by the Company.

If the Company determines that the person upon whom a notification obligation has occurred pursuant to
Regulation 24.1 has not notified the Company as required, the Company shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to serve the person in default a direction notice in accordance with Regulation 24.12.

The directors shall keep a register for the purposes of Regulations 24.1 to 24.6 (inclusive) (in this
Regulation, hereafter referred to as the “Register of Substantial Interests”) and shall procure that,
whenever the Company receives information from a person in consequence of the fulfilment of an
obligation imposed on him by Regulation 24.1, that information is within three business days thereafter

(d)

a person's percentage interest in voting rights is to be calculated on the basis of all the Shares to
which voting rights are attached even if the exercise of such rights is suspended. The number of
voting rights to be considered when calculating whether a threshold has been reached, exceeded
or fallen below is the number of voting rights in existence according to the Company's most
recent disclosure made in accordance with Regulations 24.3 or 24.4;

“Qualifying Financial Instruments” means transferable securities and options, futures, swaps,
forward rate agreements and any other derivative contracts provided that they result in an
entitlement to acquire, on the holder's own initiative alone, under a formal agreement, Shares to
which voting rights are attached, already issued by the Company, or other financial instruments
giving the holder a long position on the economic performance of Shares or otherwise having a
“similar economic effect” to a Qualifying Financial Instrument within the meaning of Rule 5 of
the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules (““DTR 5”);

“Regulatory Information Service” means a service approved by the London Stock Exchange
for the distribution to the public of announcements; and

A person will be treated as being “indirectly” interested in Shares if he would be deemed so
interested under DTR 5.

are to be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether a person has a notification obligation:

Regulations 24.11 to 24.17 apply where the Company gives to a Shareholder or to any person appearing to
be interested in a Share a notice requiring any of the following information (a “Disclosure Notice”):

(a) confirmation as to whether such person is or was, at any time during the three years immediately
preceding the date on which the notice is issued (the “Three Year Period’’), interested in Shares
comprised in the Company's share capital;

(b) if he is or was so interested, particulars of his own past or present interest in Shares comprised in
the share capital of the Company held by him at any time during the Three Year Period;

(c) if he is presently interested in Shares comprised in the Company's share capital and any other
interest in the Shares persists (or in any case where another interest in the Shares subsisted during
the Three Year Period at any time when his own interest subsisted), such particulars (so far as lies
within his knowledge) with respect to that other interest as may be required by the disclosure
notice;

(d) if he was interested in Shares comprised in the Company's share capital during the Three Year
Period but is no longer interested, particulars (so far as lies within his knowledge) of the identity
of the person who had that interest immediately upon him ceasing to hold it.

If a disclosure notice is given by the Company to a person appearing to be interested in any Share, a copy
shall at the same time be given to the holding Shareholder, but the accidental omission to do so or the
non-receipt of the copy by the Shareholder shall not prejudice the operation of the provisions of
Regulations 24.1 to 24.17.

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Shareholder, or any other person appearing to be interested in
Shares held by such Shareholder, has been duly served with a disclosure notice and is in default for the
prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information thereby required, or, in purported
compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which is false or inadequate in a material particular,
then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a “direction notice”) to
such Shareholder direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares in relation to which the default occurred (the “Default Shares”) the
Shareholder shall not be entitled to vote at a Annual General Meeting either personally or by
proxy or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the
Company;

(b) where the Default Shares represent at least 1/4 per cent. of the total number of Shares of the class
concerned less any Shares of that class held in treasury by the Company, then the direction notice
may additionally direct that:

(i) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due from
the Company on the Default Shares, whether in respect of dividend or otherwise;

(ii) no other distribution shall be made on the Default Shares;
(ii1) no transfer of any of the Shares held by such Shareholder shall be registered unless:

(A) the Shareholder is not himself in default as regards supplying the information
requested and the transfer when presented for registration is accompanied by a
certificate by the Shareholder in such form as the Board may in its absolute
discretion require to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the
Shareholder is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such
information is interested in any of the Shares the subject of the transfer; or

(B) the transfer is an approved transfer.

The Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested in the Shares the subject of any
direction notice a copy of the notice, but the failure or omission by the Company to do so shall not
invalidate such notice.

Any direction notice shall cease to have effect:-

(a)

(b)

in relation to any Shares which are transferred by such Shareholder by means of an approved
transfer; or

when the Board is satisfied that such Shareholder and any other person appearing to be
interested in Shares held by such Shareholder, has given to the Company the information
required by the relevant notice.

The Board may at any time give notice cancelling a direction notice.

For the purposes of Regulations 24.11 to 24.14:-

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any Shares if the Shareholder
holding such Shares has given to the Company a notification which either (i) names such
person as being so interested or (ii) fails to establish the identities of all those interested in
the Shares and (after taking into account any such notification and any other relevant
information) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person in
question is or may be interested in the Shares;

the prescribed period is 14 days from the date of service of the said notice unless the Default
Shares represent at least 1/4 per cent. of the total number of Shares of the class concerned less
any Shares of that class held in treasury by the Company, when the prescribed period is 14
days from that date;

a transfer of Shares is an approved transfer if but only if:

(i) it is a transfer of Shares to an offer or by way or in pursuance of acceptance of a
takeover offer, meaning an offer to acquire all the Shares, or all the Shares of any
class or classes in the Company (other than Shares which at the date of the offer are
already held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same in relation
to all the Shares to which the offer relates or, where those Shares include Shares of
different classes, in relation to all the Shares of each class; or

(ii) the Board is satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of the whole of the
beneficial ownership of the Shares the subject of the transfer to a party unconnected
with the Shareholder and with other persons appearing to be interested in such
Shares;

(iii) the transfer results from a sale made through a recognised investment exchange as
defined in the Act or the Securities Regulations or any other investment exchange
on which the Company's Shares are normally traded including the AIM Market of
the London Stock Exchange; or

(iv) the transfer is made by way of a relevant system; and

for the purposes of Regulation 24.11 to 24.14 a person will be treated as having an “interest”
in Shares if:

(i) he owns them;

(ii) he has the right (whether conditional or absolute) to exercise or direct the exercise of
the voting rights attaching to them or has general control of them;

(iii) by virtue of any agreement to purchase, option or derivative he has the right or option
to acquire them or call for their delivery; or he is under an obligation to take delivery
of them, whether the right, option or obligation is conditional or absolute;

(iv) he is party to any derivative whose value is determined by reference to their price
and which results, or may result, in his having a long position in them; or

(v) he has received an irrevocable commitment in respect of them;

If any dividend or other distribution is withheld under Regulation 24.12, the Shareholder shall be entitled
to receive it as soon as practicable after the restrictions contained in Regulation 24.12 cease to apply.

25.2

If, while any of the restrictions referred to above apply to a Share, another Share is allotted as of right
pursuant to the rights attached to such Share, the same restrictions shall apply to that other Share as if it
were a Default Share. For this purpose, Shares which the Company allots, or procures to be offered, pro
rata (disregarding fractional entitlements) to holders of Shares of the same class as the Default Share shall
be treated as Shares allotted as of right of existing Shares from the date on which the allotment is
unconditional or, in the case of Shares so offered, the date of the acceptance of the offer.

warrants, options and other similar instruments (whether in certified or uncertified form) from time to

time.

Where any warrants or options are withdrawn or otherwise cancelled by the Company, the Directors shall
take such steps as are necessary to effect the cancellation of such warrants or options.
