What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court
having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF SHARES

Shareholders may mortgage or charge their Shares in the Company and upon satisfactory
evidence thereof the Company shall give effect to the terms of any valid mortgage or charge
except in so far as it may conflict with any requirements herein contained for consent to the

Shareholders:

(b) the date on which the mortgage. or. charge was created;

(c) the name of the mortgagee or chargee; and

(d) the date on which the aforesaid particulars are entered in the Register of Shareholders.

Where particulars of a mortgage or charge are registered, such particulars shall only be
cancelled:

(a) with the consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorised to act on his
behalf; or
(b) upon evidence satisfactory to the Directors of the discharge of the liability secured by the

mortgage or charge and the issue of such indemnities as the Directors shall consider
necessary or desirable.

Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge are registered, no transfer of any Share comprised
therein shall be effected without the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or
anyone authorised to act on his behalf.

FORFEITURE

Where Shares are not fully paid on issue, or are issued for a promissory note or other written
obligation for payment of a debt or have been issued subject to forfeiture, the following provisions
shall apply.

the promissory note or other written obligation for payment of a debt shall be served on a
Shareholder who defaults in making payment in respect of a Share whether pursuant to a
promissory note or other written obligation for payment of a debt or otherwise.

43.

44.

45.

46.

47.

48.

49.

50.

service of the notice on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be
made; and

(b) contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before the time named in the
notice the Shares, or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be liable
to be forfeited.

been complied with, the Directors may at any time before tender of payment forfeit and cancel the
Shares to which the notice relates.

The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to the Shareholder whose Shares
have been forfeited and cancelled pursuant to these Regulations. Upon forfeiture and
cancellation of the Shares the Shareholder is discharged from any further obligation to the
Company with respect to the Shares forfeited and cancelled.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The Directors may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such manner and
places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors consider necessary or
desirable, however, the failure to satisfy this Regulation does not invalidate the meeting.

entitled to vote in the Company, on the matter for which the meeting is being requested, the
Directors shall convene a meeting of Shareholders.

The Directors shall give-not less than seven days’ notice of meetings of Shareholders to those
persons whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the Register of

(b) votes of each class of Shares where Shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class
together with not less than an absolute majority of the remaining votes,

have waived notice of the meeting and for this purpose presence at the meeting shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver.

The inadvertent failure of the Directors to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder, or the fact
that a Shareholder has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and
vote on behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place appointed for the meeting
before the time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes

Company in all matters as are not by the Act or the Memorandum or these Articles required to be
exercised by the Shareholders and inJlieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in writing and sign
a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or
memorandum shall constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At every meeting of the Directors the chairman of the Board of Directors shall preside as
chairman of the meeting. If there is no chairman of the Board of Directors or if the chairman of
the Board of Directors is not present at the meeting the vice chairman of the Board of Directors
shall preside. If there is no vice chairman of the Board of Directors or if the vice chairman of the
Board of Directors is not present at the meeting the Directors present shall choose someone of
their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the Directors or a committee of Directors at a meeting may also
be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a committee of Directors consented to in writing or by
telex, telegram, cable, facsimile or other written electronic communication by all Directors or all
members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The consent

Directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of these Articles regulating the
proceedings of Directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the
resolution establishing the committee.

shail be considered necessary or expedient. Such officers may consist of a chairman of the
Board of Directors, a vice chairman of the Board of Directors, president and one or more vice

deemed desirable. Any number of offices may be held by the same person.

The officers shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed at the time of their appointment

Where a Director’s interest in a transaction is not disclosed in accordance with this Regulation
prior to the transaction being entered into, unless it is not required to be disclosed in accordance
with Regulation 109 below, the transaction is voidable by the Company.

Notwithstanding the previous Regulation, a transaction entered into by the Company is not
voidable by the Company if:

(a) the material facts of the interest of the Director in the transaction are known by the
Shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting of Shareholders and the transaction is
approved or ratified by a Resolution.of Shareholders; or

is made on the basis of the information known to the Company and the interested
Director at the time that the transaction was entered into.

Company and the Director and the transaction or proposed transaction is or is to be entered into

included among the Directors present at the meeting for the purpose of a quorum; and

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company may indemnify against all expenses,
including legal fees, and against all judgements, fines and amounts paid in settlement and
reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any
person (an "Indemnifiable Person”) who:

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that the person is or was a Director, an officer, agent or a liquidator of the
Company; or

16
112.

113.

114.

115.

116.

117.

118.

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a Director, officer, agent or liquidator
of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The Company may only indemnify an Indemnifiable Person if such person acted honestly and in
good faith and in what the Indemnificable Person believed to be in the best interests of the
Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the Indemnifiable Person had no reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the Directors as to whether the Indemnifiable Person acted honestly and in good
faith in what the Indemnificable Person believed to be in the best interests of the Company and,
in the case of criminal proceedings, as to whether such person had no reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful, is in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of
these Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgement, order, settlement, conviction or the
