In the case of uncertificated Shares, a Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer his Shares by means
of a Relevant System and the operator of the Relevant System shall act as agent of the Shareholders
for the purposes of the transfer of Shares. In addition to the foregoing, a transferor of uncertificated
Shares is effective only if a record of the transfer evidencing the transferor’s consent is available
and the statutory particulars in respect of the transferee are entered in the register of members.

The transferor of any Shares shall remain the holder of those Shares until the name of the transferee
is entered in the register as the holder of those Shares.

The register of members may be closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from
time to time determine, not exceeding in aggregate thirty days in each year, upon notice being given
by advertisement in a leading daily newspaper and in such other newspaper (if any) as may be
required by the Act and the practice of the Stock Exchanges (as applicable).

The Board may decline to register a transfer of any Share to a person known to be a minor,
bankrupt or person who is mentally disordered or a patient for the purpose of any statute relating to
mental health.

The Board may also decline to register any transfer of Shares unless:-

(a) any written instrument of transfer, duly stamped (if so required), is lodged within the
Company at the registered office or such other place as the Board may appoint accompanied
by the certificate for the Shares to which it relates (except in the case of a transfer by a
recognized person ora holder of such Shares in respect of whom the Company is not
required by law to deliver_a certificate and to whom a certificate has not been issued in
respect of such Shares);

(b) any instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class or series of Share; and

(c) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the Share is
to be transferred does not exceed four.

The Company may retain an instrument of transfer which is registered but a transfer which the
Directors refuse to register shall (except in the case of known or suspected fraud) be returned to the
person lodging it when the notice of refusal is given.

If the Board declines to register a transfer it shall, within two months or such other period (if any) as
may be prescribed by the Act, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any transfer, probate, letters of
administration, certificate of death or marriage, power of attorney, distringas or stop notice, order of
court or other instrument relating to or affecting the title of any Share, or otherwise making any
entry in the Register relating to any Share.

The executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder, the guardian of an incompetent member or
the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having
any title to his Share but they shall not be entitled to exercise any rights as a Shareholder of the
Company until they have proceeded as set forth in the next following three Regulations.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters
of administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased Shareholder or of the
appointment of a guardian of any incompetent Shareholder or the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder
shall be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder is
domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document evidencing the grant of probate or
letters of administration, confirmation as executor, appointment as guardian or trustee in
bankruptcy is issued by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the
purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter
the Directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The Directors may also require an indemnity to
be given by the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in consequence
of death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered as a Shareholder upon
such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Directors and in the case of
uncertificated Shares subject also to the facilities and requirements of the Relevant System
concerned. An application by any such person to be registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes
be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and the
Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death, incompetence
or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself, request in writing that
some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such Share or Shares and such
request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court
having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

The transfer of a Share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of
members.

If the directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has
been signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of
Directors:

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the
absence of the instrument of transfer.

Subject to the Memorandum, the personal representative of a deceased Shareholder may transfer a
Share even though the personal representative is not a Shareholder-at the time of the transfer.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The board shall convene and the Company shall hold annual general meetings at least once in
each calendar year.

Subject to the requirements of the Act, and Regulation 7.1, any director of the Company may
convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such manner and places within or
outside the British Virgin Islands as the director considers necessary or desirable.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 30 percent or more of the voting rights
in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting
of Shareholders.

Subject to the Act and the Listing Rules, the director convening a meeting shall give not less than 14
clear days notice of a meeting of Shareholders to:

(a) those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in
the register of members and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and

(b) the other directors.

The director convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining
those Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or
such other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90 percent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered
at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a
Shareholder at the meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that
Shareholder holds.

7.7 The inadvertent failure of a director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a
Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not received
notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

7.8 A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote
on behalf of the Shareholder.

7.9 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting before
the time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The
notice of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or time at which the proxy shall be
presented.

7.10 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following form (as required by the
Listing Rules) or such other form as the chairman of the meeting shall accept as properly evidencing
the wishes of the Shareholder appointing the proxy.

the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the
adjourned meeting there are present within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in
person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the Shares or each class or series of Shares
entitled to vote on the matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a
quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be dissolved.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the
meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present at the
meeting, the directors of the Company present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman.
If the Shareholders are unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the
greatest number of voting Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as
chairman failing which the oldest individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present
shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and
from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the
business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he
considers appropriate whether any resolution proposed has been. carried or not and the result of his
decision shall be announced.to the meeting and recorded in the. minutes of the meeting. If the
chairman has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll
to be taken of all votes cast upon such resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any
Shareholder present in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman of the
result of any vote may immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the
chairman shall cause a poll to.be taken. If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced
to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of
representatives of Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a
Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which,
the Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the directors may in good faith seek
legal advice from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall
otherwise rule, the directors may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to any
Shareholder or the Company.

Any Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or
other governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any
meeting of Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be
entitled to exercise the same rights on behalf of the Shareholder which he represents as that
Shareholder could exercise if it were an individual.

The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Person other than

produced within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such
Person shall be disregarded.

Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any
separate meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

approval of the same on behalf of that director. Any exercise by the alternate director of the
appointing director's powers in relation to the taking of decisions by the directors is as effective as

agent of or for the appointing director and is liable for his own acts and omissions as an alternate

to the director appointing him (if any), as agreed between such alternate and the director appointing
him.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company
may, when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, act in a manner which he believes is
in the best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the
Company.

Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised
representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the directors, with respect to the
signing of consents or otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to
incur indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations
whether of the Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all
receipts for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise

necessary or desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or
other electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of
directors held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the
directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this
purpose the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The
inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not
received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and the
alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed him and to
vote or consent in place of the director until the appointment lapses or is terminated.

are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of directors, unless
there are only 2 directors in which case the quorum is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of directors do
not apply and such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters
as are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the
Shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign a
note or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or
memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the
directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken
by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors consented to in writing or
by telex, telegram, cable or other written electronic communication by a majority of the directors or
by a majority of the members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice.
A written resolution consented to in such manner may consist of several documents, including
written electronic communication, in like form each signed or assented to by one or more directors.
If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the
resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last director has consented to the resolution
by signed counterparts.

The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of
one or more directors, and delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the

Sub-Regulation 11.2(b) and (c) do not prevent a committee of directors, where authorised by
the Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors,
from appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-
committee.

interested in Shares held by such Shareholder, has been duly served with a disclosure notice and is
in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information thereby required,
or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which is false or inadequate

(b)

in respect of the Shares in relation;to: which the default-occurred (the "Default Shares")
the Shareholder shall not be entitled to vote at a Annual General Meeting either personally
or by proxy or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings
of the Company;

the class concerned less any Shares of that class/held in treasury by the Company, then the

(11) no other distribution shall be made on the Default Shares;

(ili) no transfer of any of the Shares held by such Shareholder shall be registered
unless:

(A) the Shareholder is not himself in default as regards supplying the
information requested and the transfer when presented for registration is
accompanied by a certificate by the Shareholder in such form as the Board
may in its absolute discretion require to the effect that after due and careful
enquiry the Shareholder is satisfied that no person in default as regards
supplying such information is interested in any of the Shares the subject of
the transfer; or

(B) the transfer is an approved transfer.

(b)

interested in Shares held by such Shareholder, has given to the Company the information
required by the relevant notice.

The Board may at any time give notice cancelling a direction notice.

For the purposes of Regulations 25.11 to 25.14:-

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any Shares if the Shareholder
holding such Shares has given to the Company a notification which either (i) names such
person as being so interested or (ii) fails to establish the identities of all those interested in
the Shares and (after taking into account any such notification and any other relevant
information) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person in
question is or may be interested in the Shares;

the prescribed period is 14 days from the date of service of the said notice unless the
Default Shares represent at least 1/4 per cent. of the total number of Shares of the class
concerned less any Shares of that class held in treasury by the Company, when the
prescribed period is 14 days from that date;

a transfer of Shares.is an-approved transfer if but only if:

(i) it is a transfer of Shares to an offer or by way or in pursuance of acceptance of a
takeover offer, meaning an offer to acquire all the Shares, or all the Shares of any
class or classes in the Company (other than Shares which at the date of the offer
are already held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same in
relation to all the Shares to which the offer relates or, where those Shares include
Shares of different classes, in relation to all the Shares of each class; or

(i1) the Board is satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of the whole of
the beneficial ownership of the Shares the subject of the transfer to a party
unconnected with the Shareholder and with other persons appearing to be
interested in such Shares;

(ili) the transfer results from a sale made through a Recognised Investment Exchange
as defined in the Act or the Securities Regulations or any other investment
exchange on which the Company's Shares are normally traded including the Stock
Exchanges; or

(iv) the transfer is made by way of a Relevant System; and

for the purposes of Regulation 25.11 to 25.14 a person will be treated as having an
“interest” in Shares if:

(i) he owns them;

(11) he has the right (whether conditional or absolute) to exercise or direct the exercise
of the voting rights attaching to them or has general control of them;

(ii1) by virtue of any agreement to purchase, option or derivative he has the right or
option to acquire them or call for their delivery; or he is under an obligation to
take delivery of them, whether the right, option or obligation is conditional or
absolute;

27
25.16

25.17

26

26.1

26.2

(iv) he is party to any derivative whose value is determined by reference to their price
and which results, or may result, in his having a long position in them; or

(v) he has received an irrevocable commitment in respect of them;

If any dividend or other distribution is withheld under Regulation 25.12, the Shareholder shall be
entitled to receive it as soon as practicable after the restrictions contained in Regulation 25.12 cease

to apply.

If, while any of the restrictions referred to above apply to a Share, another Share is allotted as of
right pursuant to the rights attached to such Share, the same restrictions shall apply to that other
Share as if it were a Default Share. For this purpose, Shares which the Company allots, or procures
to be offered, pro rata (disregarding fractional entitlements) to holders of Shares of the same class
as the Default Share shall be treated as Shares allotted as of right of existing Shares from the date
on which the allotment is unconditional or, in the case of Shares so offered, the date of the
acceptance of the offer.
