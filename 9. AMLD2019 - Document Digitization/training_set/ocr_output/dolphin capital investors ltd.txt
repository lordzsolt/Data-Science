par value), provided that in respect of shares held jointly by several persons, the Company shall
not be bound to issue more than one certificate and delivery of a certificate for a share to one of
several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.

chargee whose interest has been noted on the register of members, be renewed on production of
the worn out certificate, or on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as the
directors may reasonably require. Any member receiving a share certificate shall indemnify and
hold the Company and its officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by
reason of wrongful or fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the
possession of such a certificate.

The Directors shall permit shares to be held in uncertificated form and shall have power to
implement such arrangements as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit in order for any

shares and to be a participating security (subject always to the requirements of the Relevant
System concerned).

Where the arrangements described in Article 1.4 are implemented, no provision of these Articles
shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with:

(a) the holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form;
(b) the transfer of title to such shares of that class by means of a Relevant System;
(c) the requirements of the Relevant System.

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles (but subject always to any applicable law
and regulations and the facilities and requirements of any Relevant System):

(a) unless the Directors otherwise determine, shares held by the same holder or joint holder
in certificated form and uncertificated form shall be treated as separate holdings;

(b) conversion of shares held in certificated.form into shares held in uncertificated form, and
vice versa, may be made in such a manner.as the Directors may in their absolute
discretion think fit;

(c) shares may be changed: from uncertificated. to certificated form, and from certificated to
uncertificated form, in. such manner as the Directors may in their absolute discretion, think
fit;

(d) Article 6 shall not apply in respect of shares recorded on the register as being held in
uncertificated form to the extent that Article 6 requires or contemplates the effecting of a
transfer by an instrument in writing and the production of a certificate for the share to be
transferred;

(e) a Class of share shall not be treated as two classes by virtue only of that class comprising
both certificated and uncertificated shares.or as a result of any provision of these Articles

uncertificated shares;

(f) The Directors shall, subject to applicable laws and regulations, be entitled to require the

part of the original or any increased authorised shares) shall be at the disposal of the directors

limitation) the evidencing of title to and transfer of interests in shares in the capital of the
Company in the form of depositary interests or similar interests, instruments or securities, and to

Transfer of Shares

Shares in the Company shall be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by the
transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. The instrument of transfer
shall also be signed by the transferee if registration as a holder of the shares imposes a liability to
the Company on the transferee. The instrument of transfer of a registered share shall be sent to
the Company for registration.

Subject to the Memorandum of Association, these Articles and to section 54(5) of the Act, the
Company shall, on receipt of an instrument of transfer, enter the name of the transferee of the
share in the register of members unless the directors resolve to refuse or delay the registration of
the transfer for reasons that shall be specified in the resolution. Where the directors pass such a
resolution, the Company shall send to the transferor and the transferee a notice of the refusal or
delay. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Memorandum or Articles, the directors shall
not decline to register any transfer of shares, nor may they suspend registration thereof where
such transfer is:

(a) to any mortgagee or chargee whose interest has been noted on the register of members;

(b) by any such mortgagee or chargee, pursuant to. the power of sale under its security; or

(c) by any such mortgagee or chargee in accordance with the terms of the relevant security
document.

The transfer of a registered share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered in the
register of members.

The board of Directors may, in.its absolute discretion, and without assigning any reason therefor,
refuse to register any transfers of shares which are not fully paid PROVIDED THAT such
discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares of a class
from taking place on an open and proper basis.

Subject to any limitations in the Memorandum, the Company must on the application of the
transferor or transferee of a registered share in the Company enter in the share register the name
of the transferee of the share save that the registration of transfers may be suspended and the
share register closed at such times and for such periods as the Company may from time to time by
resolution determine provided always that such registration shall not be suspended and the share
register closed for more than 60 days in any period of 12 months.

Mortgages of Shares and Charges Over Shares
Members may mortgage or create a charge or other form of security over their shares.

over his shares, enter in the register of members of the Company:

(a) a statement that such shares are mortgaged or charged;

(b) the name of the mortgagee or chargee (where such information has been stated by the
member); and
7.1

7.2

(c) the date on which the statement and name are entered in the register of members.
Transmission of Shares

Subject to sections 52(2) and 53 of the Act, the executor or administrator of a deceased member,
the guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only
person recognised by the Company as having any title to his share, save that and only in the
event of death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member or members of the Company as a
consequence of which the Company no longer has any directors or members, then upon the
production of any documentation which is reasonable evidence of the applicant being entitled to:

(a) a grant of probate of the deceased's will, or grant of letters of administration of the
deceased's estate, or confirmation of the appointment as executor or administrator (as the
case may be, or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction), of a deceased member's
estate;

(b) the appointment of a guardian (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of an
incompetent member;

(c) the appointment as trustee (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of a
bankrupt member; or

(d) upon production of any other reasonable evidence of the applicant's beneficial ownership
of, or entitlement to the shares,

to the Company's registered agent in the British Virgin Islands together with (if so requested by
the registered agent) a notarised copy of the share certificate(s) of the deceased, incompetent or
bankrupt member, an indemnity in favour of the registered agent and/or appropriate legal advice
in respect of any document issued by a foreign court, then the administrator, executor, guardian
or trustee in bankruptcy (as the case may be) notwithstanding that their name has not been
entered in the share register of the Company, may by written resolution of the applicant,
endorsed with written approval by the registered agent, be appointed a director of the Company
and/or entered in the share register as the legal and/or beneficial owner of the shares.

Without limiting the foregoing, the production to the Company of any document which is
reasonable evidence of:

(a) a grant of probate of the will, or grant of letters of administration of the estate, or
confirmation of the appointment as executor (or analogous position in the relevant
jurisdiction), of a deceased member;

(b) the appointment of a guardian (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of an
incompetent member;

(c) the trustee (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of a bankrupt member; or
(d) the applicant's legal and/or beneficial ownership of the shares,
shall be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent member or bankrupt

member is resident and/or domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document is issued
by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purposes of
7.3

establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the
directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The directors may also require an indemnity to be
given by the executor, administrator, guardian, trustee in bankruptcy or the applicant.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a share or shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may be registered as a
member upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the directors. An
application by any such person to be registered as a member shall for all purposes be deemed to
be a transfer of shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member and the directors shall
treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of the death,
incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may, instead of being registered himself, request in
writing that some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such share or
shares and such request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court
having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

shares which it is authorised to issue and in connection therewith the Company may in respect of

The Company may by a resolution of directors amend the Memorandum to:

(a) divide the shares, including issued shares, of a class or series into a larger number of
shares of the same class or series; or

(b) combine the shares, including issued shares, of a class or series into a smaller number of
shares of the same class or series,

provided, however, that where shares are divided or combined under (a) or (b) of this Article, the
aggregate par value of the new shares must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original
shares.

The directors may, on behalf of the Company, subject to the written consent of all the members
whose shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company's own shares for such consideration as the directors
consider fit, and either cancel or hold such shares as treasury shares. Shares may be purchased
or otherwise acquired in exchange for newly issued shares in the Company.

The directors shall not, unless permitted pursuant to the Act, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of the Company's own shares unless immediately after such purchase, redemption or

reasonable grounds that at all times before the exercise of the power that the committee would
exercise the power in conformity with the.duties.imposed on directors of the Company by the Act.

The directors of the Company may, by Resolution. of Directors, appoint officers of the Company at
such times as shall be considered necessary or expedient. The officers shall perform such duties

not have a second or casting vote.

A director shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone
or other electronic means of communication and all directors participating in the meeting are able
to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than three days' notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of
directors held without three days notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the
directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend, waive notice of the meeting and for
this purpose, the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver on his part. The
inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not
received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and an
alternate is entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed him and to
vote or consent in place of the director.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting
there are present in person or by alternate not less than one half of the total number of directors,
unless there are only two directors in which case the quorum shall be two.

If the Company shall have only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of the
directors shall not apply but such sole director shall have full power to represent and act for the
Company in all matters as are not by the Act or the Memorandum or these Articles required to be
exercised by the members of the Company and in lieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in
writing and sign a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a resolution of directors. Sucha
note or memorandum shall constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

The Board of Directors may elect one of their number as Chairman of their meetings and
determine the period for which he is to hold office. At every meeting of the directors the Chairman
of the Board of Directors shall preside as chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the
Board of Directors or if the Chairman of.the=Board of Directors is not present at the meeting the
Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors shall preside. If there is no Vice Chairman of the Board
of Directors or if the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors is not present at the meeting the
directors present shall choose someone of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken-by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be
taken by a Resolution of Directors or a committee of directors consented to in writing or by telex,
telegram, cable, facsimile or other written electronic communication by all Directors or all
members of the committee-as the case may be, without the need for any notice.

The directors shall cause the following corporate records to be kept:

(a) minutes of all meetings of directors, members, committees of directors, committees of
officers and committees of members;

(b) copies of all resolutions consented to by directors, members, committees of directors,
committees of officers and committees of members; and

necessary or desirable in order to reflect the financial position of the Company.

The books, records and minutes shall be kept at the registered office of the Company, its
principal place of business or at such other place as the directors determine.

The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each
consisting of one or more directors.

Each committee of directors has such powers and authorities of the directors, including the power
and authority to affix the Seal, as are set forth in the resolution of directors establishing the
committee, except that no committee has any power or authority to amend the Memorandum or
these Articles, to appoint directors or fix their emoluments, or to appoint officers or agents of the
Company.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of two or more directors
shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of these Articles regulating the proceedings
of directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the resolution
establishing the committee.

For a period of one year from the amendment of the Memorandum and Articles to include this
Article 16.14, each member holding 7.5 per cent or more of the Company’s issued shares shall
be entitled to appoint an observer to the Board of Directors. Each such observer shall be:

(a) provided with advance notice of meetings of directors as if he were a director;
(b) entitled to attend and speak, but not vote, at meetings of directors; and
(c) provided with, and granted access to, all such information and documentation relating to

the Company as a director is entitled to, including, all information and documentation
provided to directors in advance of, during and following meetings of directors.

Indemnification and Insurance

Subject to the provisions of the Act and the subsequent provisions of this Article, the Company
may indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement and.reasonably incurred in.connection with legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings any person who:

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that the person is or was a director of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity
is or was acting for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

This Article applies only to a person who_has_acted honestly and in good faith and in what he
believed to be the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the
person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The Company shall
not indemnify a person who has not so acted, and any indemnity given to such a person is void
and of no effect. A director acts in the best interests of the Company if he acts in the best
interests of:

(a) the Company’s holding company; or

(b) a shareholder or shareholders of the Company;

in either case, in the circumstances specified in the sub-Articles below, as the case may be:

The termination of any proceedings by any judgement, order, settlement, conviction or the
entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act

honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person
had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that the director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company
in accordance with this Article.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former director in defending any legal,
administrative or investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final
disposition of such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former
director to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the former director is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with this Article and upon such other
terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this
Article is not exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, resolution of members,
resolution of disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to acting in the person's official capacity
and as to acting in another capacity while serving as a director of the Company.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a
director of the Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director of,
or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by
the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power to
indemnify the person against the liability under the foregoing Article.

Notification of Interest in Shares

For so long as the Company has any. of iis Shares admitted to trading on AIM, or any successor
market or any other market operated by the London Stock Exchange plc., every member shall
comply with the notification and disclosure requirements set out in Chapter 5 of the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules Sourcebook (as amended and varied from time to time) of the FSA
Handbook as if the Company were classified as.an "issuer" whose "Home State" is the "United
Kingdom" (as such terms are defined in the FSA Handbook).

If it shall come to the notice of the directors that any member has not, within the requisite period
made or, as the case may be, procured the making of any notification required by this Article, the
Company may (at the absolute discretion of the directors) at any time thereafter by notice (a
"Restriction Notice") to such member direct that, in respect of the shares in relation to which the
default has occurred (the "Default Shares") which expression shall include any further shares
which are issued in respect of any Default Shares), the member shall not be entitled to be present
or to vote on any question (either in person or in proxy), at any general meeting of the Company
or separate general meeting of the holders of any class of shares of the Company, or to be
recognised in a quorum or to sign a written resolution.

Where the Default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. in nominal value of the issued shares
of their class, then the restriction notice may additionally direct that in respect of the Default
Shares:

(a) any dividend or any part of a dividend or other amounts payable in respect of the Default
Shares be withheld by the Company, which has no obligation to pay interest on the same,

and shall be payable (when the restriction notice ceases to have effect) to the person who
would but for the Restriction Notice have been entitled to them; and/or

(b) where an offer of the right to elect to receive shares of the Company instead of cash in
respect of any dividend or part thereof is or has been made by the Company any election
made thereunder by such member in respect of such Default Shares shall not be
effective; and/or

(c) no transfer of any of the shares held by any such member shall be recognised or
registered by the directors unless: (1) the transfer is an excepted transfer; or (2) the
member is not himself in default as regards supplying the requisite information required
under this Article and, when presented for registration the transfer is accompanied by a
certificate by the member in a form satisfactory to the directors to the effect that after due
and careful enquiry the member is satisfied that none of the shares, the subject of the
transfer are Default Shares.

The Company shall send a copy of the Restriction Notice to each other person appearing to be
interested in the shares the subject of such notice, but the failure or omission by the Company to
do so shall not invalidate the notice.

Any Restriction Notice shall have.effect in accordance with its terms from the date it is given until
not more than seven days after the Directors are satisfied that the default in respect of which the
Restriction Notice was issued no longer continues but shall cease to have effect in relation to any
shares which are transferred by such member. The Company may (at the absolute discretion of
the directors) at any time give notice to the member cancelling or suspending for a stated period
the operation of a Restriction Notice in whole or part.

A person, other than the member holding a share, shall be treated as appearing to be interested
in that share if the member has informed the Company that the person is, or may be interested,
or the Company after taking account of information obtained from a member knows or has
reasonable cause to believe that the person is, or maybe, so interested.

Request for Information

The directors shall have power by notice in writing to require any member to disclose to the
Company the identity of any person other than the member (an "Interested Party") who has any
interest in the Relevant Share Capital held by the member and the nature of such interest.

Any such notice shall require any information in response to such notice to be given in writing
within such reasonable time as the directors shall determine.

The Company shall maintain a register of interested parties as if the register of Interested Parties
was the register of members and whenever in pursuance of a requirement imposed on a
shareholder as aforesaid the Company is informed of an Interested Party the identity of the
Interested Party and the nature of the interest shall be promptly inscribed therein together with
the date of the request.

The directors may be required to exercise their powers under Article 20.1 on the requisition of
members of the Company holding at the date of the deposit of the requisition not less than one
tenth of such of the paid-up capital of the Company as carries at that date the right of voting at
general meetings of the Company. The requisition must:-

19
19.5

(a) state that the requisitionists are requiring the Company to exercise its powers under this

Article;
(b) specify the manner in which they require those powers to be exercised; and
(c) give reasonable grounds for requiring the Company to exercise those powers in the

manner specified,
and must be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the registered office.

The requisition may consist of several documents in like form each signed by one or more
requisitionists.

On the deposit of a requisition complying with this section it is the directors’ duty to exercise their
powers under Article 20.1 in the manner specified in the requisition.

If any member has been duly served with a notice given by the directors in accordance with
Article 20.1 and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information
thereby required, then the Directors may.in-their.absolute discretion at any time thereafter serve a
notice (a “Direction Notice”) upon.such member as follows:-

(a) a Direction Notice may direct that, in respect of:-

(i) the shares comprising the shareholder account in the Register which comprises
or includes the shares in relation to which ithe default occurred (all or the relevant
number as appropriate of such shares being the “Default Shares”);

) and any other shares held by the member;

(iil) the member shall have no right to vote at a general meeting or meeting of the
holders of any class of shares of the Company either personally or by proxy or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the
Company or of the holders of any class of shares of the Company; and

(b) where the Default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. of the class of shares
concerned, then the direction notice may additionally direct that:

(i) in respect of the Default Shares, any dividend or part thereof which would
otherwise be payable on such shares shall be retained by the Company without
any liability to pay interest thereon when such money is finally paid to the
member;

(ii) no transfer other than an excepted transfer (as defined below) of any of the
shares held by such member shall be registered unless:-

(A) the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information
requested; and

(B) the transfer is of part only of the member’s holding and when presented

for registration is accompanied by a certificate by the member in a form
satisfactory to the Directors to the effect that after due and careful enquiry

20
19.6

19.7

19.8

19.9

19.10

the member is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying
such information has an interest in any of the shares the subject of the
transfer.

The Company shall send to each other person appearing to have an Interest in
the shares the subject of any Direction Notice a copy of the notice, but failure or
omission by the Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice.

If shares are issued to a member as a result of that member holding other shares in the Company
and if the shares in respect of which the new shares are issued are Default Shares in respect of
which the member is for the time being subject to particular restrictions, the new shares shall on
issue become subject to the same restrictions whilst held by that member as such Default
Shares. For this purpose, shares which the Company procures to be offered to members pro rata
(or pro rata ignoring fractional entitlements and shares not offered to certain members by reason
of legal or practical problems associated with offering shares outside the United Kingdom) shall
be treated as shares issued as a result of a member holding other shares in the Company.

Any Direction Notice shall have effect in accordance with its terms for as long as the default, in
respect of which the Direction Notice wassssued, continues but shall cease to have effect in
relation to any shares which are transferred by such member by means of an excepted
transfer(as defined below). As soon as,practical after the Direction Notice has ceased to have
effect (and in any event within seven days thereafter) the Directors shall procure that the
restrictions imposed by Articles 20.5 and 20.6 above shall be removed and that dividends and
other monies withheld pursuant to Article 20.5(b)(i) above are paid to the relevant member.

For the purpose of this Article:-

(a) a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any shares if the member
holding such shares has given to the Company a notification which either (a) names such
person as having an Interest in Relevant Share Capital or (b) fails to establish the
identities of those having an Interest in Relevant Share Capital in the shares and (after
taking into account the said notification and any other relevant notification) the Company
knows or has reasonable cause. to.believe that the person in question is or may have an
interest in the Relevant Share Capital;

(b) the prescribed period in respect of any particular member is 28 days from the date of
service of the said notice in accordance with Article 20.1 except where the Default Shares
represent at least 0.25 per cent. of the class of shares concerned in which case such
period shall be fourteen days;

Any shareholder who has given notice of an interested party in accordance with Article 20.2 who
subsequently ceases to have any party interested in his shares or has any other person
interested in his shares shall notify the Company in writing of the cessation or change in such
interest and the Directors shall promptly amend the register of interested parties accordingly.

For the purposes of this Article 20, a transfer of shares is an "excepted transfer" if, but only if:
(a) It is a transfer by way of, or in pursuance of, acceptance of a takeover offer for the
Company meaning an offer to acquire all the shares, or all the shares of any class or

classes, in the Company (other than shares which at the date of the offer are already held
by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same in relation to all the shares to

21
20.

20.1

20.2

20.3

(Cc)

which the offer relates or, where those shares include shares of different classes, in
relation to all the shares of each class; or

a transfer which is shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be made in consequence of a
sale of the whole of the beneficial interest in the shares to a person that is not Connected
with a member and with any other person appearing with or to be interested in the shares;
or

a transfer in consequence of a sale made through the London Stock Exchange plc or any
stock exchange outside of the United Kingdom on which the Company's shares of the
same class as the Default Shares are normally traded.

Company Seal and Entry into Contracts and Deeds

The directors shall provide for the safe custody of the common seal of the Company. The
common seal when affixed to any instrument (save for a share certificate in accordance with
these Articles) shall be witnessed by a director or officer of the Company or any other person so
authorised from time to time by the directors.

A contract may be entered into by the Company as follows:

or an authorised agent of the Company, and may be varied or discharged in the same
manner;

a contract that, if entered into by an individual, would be required by law to be in writing
and signed, may be entered into by or on behalf of the Company in writing and signed by
a person acting under the express or implied authority of the company, and may be varied
or discharged in the same manner; and

a contract that, if entered into by.an individual, would be valid although entered into orally,
and not reduced to writing, may be entered into orally by or on behalf of the Company by
a person acting under the express or implied authority of the Company, and may be
varied or discharged in the same manner.

Notwithstanding the foregoing Article, an instrument is validly executed by the Company as a
deed, or an instrument under seal, if it is either:

(a)

sealed with the common seal of the Company and witnessed by a director of the
Company and/or such other person who is authorised by the Memorandum or Articles to
witness the application of the Company’s seal; or

Company's liabilities and the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due. . In the event that
dividends are paid in specie the directors shall have responsibility for establishing and recording
in the Resolution of Directors authorising the dividends, a fair and proper value for the assets to
be so distributed. No distribution shall be paid on those shares which are held by the Company as
treasury shares at the date of declaration of the distribution.

The directors may, before recommending any distribution, set aside out of the profits of the
Company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at their discretion,

directors may from time to time think fit.

receipt for any distribution or other monies payable on or in respect of the share.

Notice of any distribution that may have been declared shall be given to each member in manner
hereinafter mentioned and all distributions unclaimed for three years after having been declared
may be forfeited by the directors for the benefit of the Company.

No distribution shall bear interest against the Company.

(b) minutes of all meetings and all resolutions of directors and committees of directors.

Where any such records are kept at a place other than at the office of the Company’s registered
