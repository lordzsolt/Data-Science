or under the Seal specifying the number of Shares held by him and the signature of the director, officer or authorised person and the Seal may be
facsimiles.

Any Shareholder receiving a certificate shall indemnify and hold the Company and its directors and officers harmless from any loss or liability which
it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the possession thereof. Ifa
certificate for Shares is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate or on satisfactory proof of its loss together with
such indemnity as may be required by Resolution of Directors.

If several Persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, any one of such Persons may give an effectual receipt for any Distribution.

SHARES

Shares and other Securities may be issued at such times, to such Persons, for such consideration and on such terms as the directors may by Resolution
of Directors determine.

Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note, or other written obligation to contribute money or
property, real property, personal property (including goodwill and know-how), services rendered or a contract for future services.

No Shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of Directors has been passed stating:
(a) the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares;

(b) the determination of the directors of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money consideration for the issue; and

(c) that, in the opinion of the directors, the present cash value of the non-money consideration for the issue is not less than the amount to be
credited for the issue of the Shares.

The Company shall keep a register (the “register of members”) containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the Persons who hold Shares;

(b) the number of each class and series of Shares held by each Shareholder;

(c) the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the register of members; and
(d) the date on which any Person ceased to be a Shareholder.

The register of members may be in any such form as the directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the
Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its contents. Until the directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data
storage form shall be the original register of members.

A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the register of members.

Nothing in these Articles shall require title to any shares or other securities of the Company to be evidenced by a certificate if the BVI Companies Act
and the rules of the Stock Exchanges permit otherwise.

Subject to the BVI Companies Act and the rules of the Stock Exchanges, the Board without further consultation with the holders of any Shares or
securities of the Company may resolve that any class or series of Shares or other securities of the Company from time to time in issue or to be issued
(including shares in issue at the date of the adoption of these Articles) may be issued, held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise dealt with
in uncertificated form in accordance with the Regulations and practices instituted by the operator of the relevant system and no provision of these
Articles will apply to any uncertificated share or other securities of the Company to the extent that they are inconsistent with the holding of such
shares or other securities in uncertificated form or the transfer of title to any such shares or other securities by means ofa relevant system or any
provision of the Regulations.

Conversion of shares held in certificated form into shares held in uncertificated form, and vice versa, may be made in such manner as the Board may,
in its absolute discretion, thinks fit (subject always to the Regulations and the requirements of the relevant system concerned). The Company shall
enter on the register of members how many Shares are held by each Shareholder in uncertificated form and in certificated form and shall maintain the
register of members in each case as is required by the Regulations and the relevant system concerned. Notwithstanding any provision of these
Articles, a class or series of Shares shall not be treated as two classes by virtue only of that class or series comprising both certificated Shares and
uncertificated Shares or as a result of any provision of these Articles or the Regulations which apply only in respect of certificated or uncertificated
Shares.

Ifa share certificate for certificated Shares is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed it may be replaced without fee but on such terms (if any) as to
evidence and indemnity and to payment of any exceptional out-of-pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence and preparing
such indemnity as the Board may think fit and, in case of defacement or wearing out, on delivery up of the old certificate to the Company.

All forms of certificate for share or loan capital or other securities of the Company (other than letters of allotment, scrip certificates and other like
documents) shall be issued under the Seal or in such other manner as the Board may authorise. The Board may by Resolution of Directors determine,
either generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures on any such certificate need not be autographic but may be affixed to such
certificate by some mechanical or electronic means or may be printed thereon or that such certificate need not be signed by any person.

from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the
possession thereof.

respect of such Shares.

REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own Shares save that the Company may not, except pursuant to Sub-
Regulation 3.7, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent of Shareholders whose Shares are to be purchased,
redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the Company is permitted by the Act or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.

The Company may only offer to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Shares if the Resolution of Directors authorising the purchase, redemption or
other acquisition contains a statement that the directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the acquisition the value of the
Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Sections 60 (Process for acquisition of own shares), 61 (Offer to one or more shareholders) and 62 (Shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of
company) of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to this Regulation may be cancelled or held as Treasury Shares except to
the extent that such Shares are in excess of 50% of the issued Shares in which case they shall be cancelled but they shall be available for reissue.

All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be exercised by the Company while it holds the Share as a
Treasury Share.

Treasury Shares may be transferred by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise inconsistent with the Memorandum and the Articles)
as the Company may by Resolution of Directors determine.

Where:
(a) the Company undertakes any division of the issued Shares pursuant to section 40A of the Act, and
(b) pursuant such division a Shareholder holds a total number of Shares which includes a fractional Share,

the Company may compulsorily redeem such fractional Share so that (subsequent to such redemption) the Shareholder holds a whole number of
Shares. Where the Company compulsorily redeems a fractional Share under this Regulation, the price at which such fractional Share is redeemed shall
be calculated on the basis of US$1.50 per Share (rounded up to the nearest 1¢).

of the notice on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or
before the time named in the notice the Shares, or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be liable to be forfeited.

TRANSFER AND TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

Subject to any limitations in the Memorandum, certificated Shares in the Company may be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by
the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee, but in the absence of such written instrument of transfer the Directors may accept
such evidence ofa transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate.

In the case of uncertificated Shares, and subject to the BVI Companies Act, a Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer his Shares and other securities
by means ofa relevant system and the operator of the relevant system shall act as agent of the Shareholders for the purposes of the transfer of Shares or
other securities.

Any provision in these Articles in relation to the Shares shall not apply to any uncertified Shares to the extent that they are inconsistent with the
holding of any Shares in uncertificated form, the transfer of title to any Shares by means ofa relevant system and any provision of the Regulations.

The transferor of any Shares shall remain the holder of those Shares until the name of the transferee is entered in the register as the holder of those
Shares.

The Register may be closed at such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine, not exceeding in whole thirty days in
each year, upon notice being given by advertisement in a leading daily newspaper and in such other newspaper (if any) as may be required by the BVI
Companies Act and the practice of the Stock Exchanges.

The Board may decline to register a transfer of any Share to a person known to be a minor, bankrupt or person who is mentally disordered or a patient
for the purpose of any statute relating to mental health.

The Board may also decline to register any transfer unless:-.

(a) any written instrument of transfer, duly stamped (if so required), is lodged with the Company at the registered office or such other place as the
Board may appoint accompanied by the certificate for the Shares to which it relates (except in the case of a transfer by a recognised person or
a holder of such Shares in respect of whom the Company is not required by law to deliver a certificate and to whom a certificate has not been
issued in respect of such Shares);

(b) there is provided such evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, ifthe
instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so;

(c) any instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class or series of Share; and

(d) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the Share is to be transferred does not exceed four.

The Company may retain an instrument of transfer which is registered but a transfer which the Directors refuse to register shall (except in the case of
known or suspected fraud) be returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is given.

If the Board declines to register a transfer it shall, within ten business days or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by the BVI Companies
Act, send to the transferee notice of the refusal.

No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any transfer, probate, letters of administration, certificate of death or marriage, power of
attorney, distringas or stop notice, order of court or other instrument relating to or affecting the title of any Share, or otherwise making any entry in

The executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder, the guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder shall be the
only person recognised by the Company as having any title to his Share but they shall not be entitled to exercise any rights as a Shareholder of the
Company until they have proceeded as set forth in the next following three regulations.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or confirmation as
executor, of a deceased Shareholder or of the appointment ofa guardian of an incompetent Shareholder or the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder shall
be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the
document evidencing the grant of probate or letters of administration, confirmation as executor, appointment as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy is
issued by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent
jurisdiction in such a matter the Directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The Directors may also require an indemnity to be given by the
executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any
Shareholder may be registered as a Shareholder upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Directors and in the case of
uncertificated Shares subject also to the facilities and requirements of the relevant system concerned. An application by any such person to be
registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and the
Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead
of being registered himself, request in writing that some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such Share or Shares and such
request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the
circumstances of the case.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Any director of the Company may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British
Virgin Islands as the director considers necessary or desirable provided that once in every year the directors shall convene an annual meeting of
shareholders.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is
requested the directors shall convene a meeting of Shareholders.

The director convening a meeting shall give not less than 14 days’ notice of a meeting of Shareholders to:

(a) those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the register of members of the Company and are
entitled to vote at the meeting on a date to be determined by the directors; and

(b) the other directors.

The director convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining those Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the
meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the
notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if Shareholders holding at least 90% of the total voting
rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the
meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure ofa director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a
Shareholder or another director has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting before the time for holding the meeting at which the
person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The notice of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or time at which the
proxy shall be presented.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following form or such other form as the chairman of the meeting shall accept as
properly evidencing the wishes of the Shareholder appointing the proxy.

Shareholder;
(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf ofall joint owners; and
(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one.

A meeting of Shareholders is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there are present in person or by proxy not less than 50% of
the votes of the Shares entitled to vote on Resolutions of Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single Shareholder
or proxy and then such person may pass a Resolution of Shareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a
proxy by acopy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid Resolution of Shareholders.

If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Shareholders,
shall be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting was to have been held
at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are present within one
hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the Shares or each class or series of Shares
entitled to vote on the matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting shall be dissolved.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the
Chairman of the Board is not present at the meeting, the Shareholders present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman. If the Shareholders
are unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest number of voting Shares present in person or by proxy at the
meeting shall preside as chairman failing which the oldest individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from place to place, but no business shall be
transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he considers appropriate whether any resolution
proposed has been carried or not and the result of his decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting. If the
chairman has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken ofall votes cast upon such
resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman of
the result of any vote may immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken. If
a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives of Persons other than individuals the right of
any individual to speak for or represent a Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which, the
Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the directors may in good faith seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless
and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the directors may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to any
Shareholder or the Company.

Any Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such individual as it
thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be entitled
to exercise the same rights on behalf of the Shareholder which he represents as that Shareholder could exercise ifit were an individual.

The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Person other than an individual may call for a notarially certified
copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such
Person shall be disregarded.

notice, but ifany Resolution of Shareholders is adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such
resolution shall forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the form of counterparts, each
counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the

appointed by the Director concerned.

At every annual meeting of Shareholders one-third of the Directors for the time being or, if their number is not a multiple of three, then the number
nearest to and not exceeding one-third shall retire from office.

The Directors to retire on each occasion shall be those subject to retirement by rotation who have been longest in office since their last election, but
as between persons who became or were re-elected Directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree amongst themselves) be
determined by lot. The Directors to retire on each occasion both as to number and identity) shall be determined by the composition of the Board at
the date of the notice convening the annual meeting of Shareholders, and no Director shall be required to retire or be relieved from retiring by reason
of any change in the number or identity of the Directors after the date of such notice but before the close of the meeting.

A Director who retires at the annual meeting of Shareholders shall be eligible for re-election. Ifhe is not re-elected he shall retain office until the

Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Company may by a Resolution of Shareholders at the meeting at which a Director retires in the manner
aforesaid fill the vacated office by electing a person and in default the retiring Director shall, if willing to continue to act, be deemed to have been re-
elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such Director shall
have been put to the meeting and lost.

A Director may hold the office of an Executive Director or a Non Executive Director.

An Executive Director shall receive such remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or otherwise) as the Board may
determine, and either in addition to or in lieu of his remuneration as a Director.

being so approved. Any appointment or removal of an alternate Director shall be effected by notice in writing signed by the appointor and delivered
to the registered office or tendered at a meeting of the Board. An alternate Director shall, if his appointor so requests, be entitled to receive notices of
meetings of the Board or of committees of the Board to the same extent as, but in lieu of, the Director appointing him and shall be entitled to such
extent to attend at and vote as a Director at any such meeting at which the Director appointing him is not personally present and to exercise and
discharge all the functions, powers and duties of his appointor as a Director and for the purposes of the proceedings at such meeting the provisions of

to the provisions of these Articles relating to Directors and shall alone be responsible to the Company for his acts and defaults and shall not be

deemed to be the agent of or for the Director appointing him. An alternate Director may be paid expenses and shall be entitled to be indemnified by
the Company to the same extent mutatis mutandis as if he were a Director but shall not be entitled to receive from the Company any fee in his
capacity as an alternate Director except only such part (if any) of the remuneration otherwise payable to the Director appointing him as such Director

his appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of his appointor.

An alternate Director shall ipso facto cease to be an alternate Director if his appointor ceases for any reason to be a Director provided that, if at any
meeting any Director retires by rotation or otherwise but is re-elected at the same meeting, any appointment made by him pursuant to this regulation
which was in force immediately before his retirement shall remain in force as though he had not retired.

Each of the Directors shall be paid a fee at such rate as may from time to time be determined by the Board provided that the aggregate ofall such fees
so paid to Directors (excluding amounts payable under any other regulation and any amount payable under any service contract) shall not exceed
$1,000,000 per annum, or such higher amount as may from time to time be determined by Resolution of Shareholders.

Each Director may be paid his reasonable travelling, hotel and incidental expenses of attending and returning from meetings of the Board or
committees of the Board or meetings of Shareholders or separate meetings of the holders of any class or series of Shares or of debentures of the
Company and shall be paid all expenses properly and reasonably incurred by him in the conduct of the Company’s business or in the discharge of his
duties as a Director. Any Director who, by request, goes or resides abroad for any purposes of the Company or who performs services which in the
opinion of the Board go beyond the ordinary duties ofa Director may be paid such extra remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission,
participation in profits or otherwise) as the Board may determine and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for
by or pursuant to any other regulation.

POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of, the directors of the Company. The directors of
the Company have all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The directors

Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.

Each director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company acting in a manner that contravenes the
Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each director, in exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the
director believes to be the best interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company may, when exercising powers or performing duties
as a director, act in a manner which he believes is in the best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the
Company.

Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings
of the directors, with respect to the signing of consents or otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of the Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts for moneys paid to the Company shall be
signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution
of Directors.

For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the directors may by Resolution of Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease,
exchange or other disposition is in the usual or regular course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of
fraud, conclusive.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS
Any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to each other director.

The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin
Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary or desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or other electronic means and all directors participating in
the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of directors held without 3 days’ notice having been
given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this
purpose the presence ofa director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice ofa meeting to a
director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and the alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the
absence of the director who appointed him and to vote in place of the director until the appointment lapses or is terminated.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there are present in person or by alternate not less
than one-half of the total number of directors, unless there are only 2 directors in which case the quorum is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of directors do not apply and such sole director has full power to
represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.
In lieu

of minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors.
Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the
Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of
a committee of directors consented to in writing by all directors or by all members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any
notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last director has consented to
the resolution by signed counterparts.

COMMITTEES

The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of one or more directors, and delegate one or more
of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal, to the committee.

The directors have no power to delegate to a committee of directors any of the following powers:

(a) to amend the Memorandum or the Articles;

(b) to designate committees of directors;

(c) to delegate powers to a committee of directors;

(d) to appoint or remove directors (which does not include the power to nominate a director to the board or recommend the removal of a director
from the board);

(e) to appoint or remove an agent;

(f) to approve a plan of merger, consolidation or arrangement;

(g) to make a declaration of solvency or to approve a liquidation plan; or

(h) to make a determination that immediately after a proposed Distribution the value of the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the

Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Sub-Regulation 11.2(b) and (c) do not prevent a committee of directors, where authorised by the Resolution of Directors appointing such committee
or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-
committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of 2 or more directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions
of the Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors
establishing the committee.

Where the directors delegate their powers to a committee of directors they remain responsible for the exercise of that power by the committee, unless
they believed on reasonable grounds at all times before the exercise of the power that the committee would exercise the power in conformity with the
duties imposed on directors of the Company under the Act.

TAKEOVER PROVISIONS
Except with the consent of the Board, when:

(a) any person acquires, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, Shares which (taken together with Shares held or acquired
by persons acting in concert with him) carry 30% or more of the voting rights of the Company; or

(b) any person who, together with persons acting in concert with him, holds not less than 30% but not more than 50% of the voting rights and
such person, or any person acting in concert with him, acquires additional Shares which increase his percentage of the voting rights;

such person (“the offeror’) shall extend an offer, on the basis set out in this Regulation 13, to the holders ofall the issued shares in the Company.

Any offer made under this Regulation must be conditional only upon the offeror having received acceptances in respect of Shares which, together
with Shares acquired or agreed to be acquired before or during the offer, will result in the offeror and any person acting in concert with it holding
Shares carrying more than 50% of the voting rights.

No acquisition of Shares which would give rise to a requirement for any offer under this Regulation may be made or registered if the making or
implementation of such offer would or might be dependent on the passing ofa resolution at any meeting of Shareholders of the Company or upon any
other conditions, consents or arrangements.

Offers made under this Regulation must, in respect of each class of Share capital involved, be in cash or be accompanied by a cash alternative at not
less than the highest price paid by the offeror or any person acting in concert with it for Shares of that class during the offer period and within 12
months prior to its commencement. The cash offer or the cash alternative must remain open after the offer has become or is declared unconditional as
to acceptances for not less than 14 days after the date on which it would otherwise have expired.

No nominee of an offeror or persons acting in concert with it may be appointed as a Director, nor may an offeror and persons acting in concert with it
exercise the votes attaching to any Shares held in the Company until the offer document has been posted.

Any offer required to be made pursuant to this Regulation 13 shall be made on terms that would be required by the then current United Kingdom City
Code on Takeovers and Mergers (“the City Code”), save to the extent that the board otherwise determines. In relation to any offer required to be made
pursuant to this Regulation 13, any matter which under the City Code would fall to be determined by the Panel shall be determined by the board in
its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the board to make such determination.

Except with the consent of the board, Shareholders shall comply with the requirements of the City Code and the Rules Governing Substantial
Acquisitions of Shares (“the SARS”), as may from time to time be

relation to their dealings with the Company in relation to all matters. Any matter which under the City Code or the SARS would fall to be determined
by the Panel shall be determined by the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to make such determination. Any
notice which under the City Code or the SARS is required to be given to the Panel or any person (other than the Company) shall be given to the
Company at its registered office.

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Shareholder having incurred an obligation under this Regulation 13 to extend an offer to the holders of
all the issued Shares shall have failed so to do, or that any Shareholders is in default of any other obligation imposed upon Shareholders pursuant to
this Regulation 13, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a “direction notice’’) to such Shareholders and any
other Shareholders acting in concert with such Shareholders (together “the defaulters”) direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares held by the defaulters (the “default shares’) the defaulters shall not be entitled to vote at a general meeting either

(b) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due from the Company on the default shares, whether in
respect of capital or dividend or otherwise, and the Company shall not meet any liability to pay interest on any such payment when it is

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

A director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by
the Company, disclose the interest to all other directors of the Company.

For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 14.1, a disclosure to all other directors to the effect that a director is a member, director or officer of another
named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction
which may, after the date of the entry into the transaction or disclosure of the interest, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient
disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.

A director of the Company who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the Company may:
vote on a matter relating to the transaction;

attend a meeting of directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be included among the directors present at the meeting for the
purposes of a quorum; and

sign a document on behalf of the Company, or do any other thing in his capacity as a director, that relates to the transaction,

and, subject to compliance with the Act shall not, by reason of his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from such
transaction and no such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company shall indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who:

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate ora
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

(c) The indemnity in Sub-Regulation 15.1 only applies ifthe person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the
Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 15.1(c), a director acts in the best interests of the Company ifhe acts in the best interests of
(a) the Company’s holding company; or

(b) a Shareholder or Shareholders of the Company;

in either case, in the circumstances specified in Sub-Regulation 15.1 or the Act, as the case may be.

The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as to
whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the
Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering ofa nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a director in defending any legal, administrative or investigative proceedings may be paid by the
Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that the director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with Sub-Regulation 15.1.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former director in defending any legal, administrative or investigative proceedings may be paid by the
Company in advance of the final disposition of such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former director to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the former director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with Sub-
Regulation 15.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems appropriate.

DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN SHARES AND FAILURE TO DISCLOSE

Subject to any requirement under the Act, the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules which relate to the requirement of
persons to disclose their interests in shares, shall apply to the Company as if its Home State (as defined in such rules) was the United Kingdom and
such rules shall be deemed to be incorporated into these Regulations and shall bind the Company and the Shareholders (other than the Depository).

Subject to any requirement under the Act, the provisions of section 793 of the UK CA 2006 shall be deemed to be incorporated into these
Regulations and shall bind the Company and the Shareholders and references in such section to “a public company” shall be deemed to be references
to the Company.

Where notice is served by the Company under section 793 of the UK CA 2006 (a “section 793 notice’’) on a Shareholder, or another person whom the
Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be interested in shares held by that Shareholder, and the Shareholder or other person has failed
in relation to any shares (the “default shares”, which expression includes any shares issued to such Shareholder after the date of the section 793
notice in respect of those shares) to give the Company the information required within 14 days following the date of service of the section 793 notice,
the Board may serve on the holder of such default shares a notice (a “disenfranchisement notice”) whereupon the following sanctions apply, unless
the Board otherwise decides:

25.3.1 the Shareholder shall not be entitled in respect of the default shares to be present or to vote (either in person or by proxy) at a General
Meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders ofa class of shares or on a poll or to exercise other rights conferred by membership in
relation to the meeting or poll; and

25.3.2 where the default shares represent at least 0.25 per cent in nominal value of the issued shares of their class (calculated exclusive of any
shares held as Treasury Shares):
(a) a dividend (or any part ofa dividend) or other amount payable in respect of the default shares shall be withheld by the Company,
which has no obligation to pay interest on it; and
(b) no transfer of any of the default shares shall be registered unless:
(i) the transfer is an excepted transfer; or
(ii) the Shareholder is not himself in default in supplying the information required and the Shareholder proves to the

satisfaction of the Board that no person in default in supplying the information required is interested in any of the
shares the subject of the transfer; or

-22-

(iii) registration of the transfer is required by any Relevant System,

(and, for the purpose of ensuring this Regulation 25.3.2(b) can apply to all shares held by the holder, the Company may, in accordance
with the regulations of any Relevant System, issue written notification to the operator of the Relevant System requiring the conversion
into certificated form of any shares held by the holder in uncertificated form).

REMOVAL OF SANCTIONS
The sanctions under Regulation 25 shall cease to apply seven days after the receipt by the Company of:
notice of registration of an excepted transfer, in relation to the default shares the subject of the excepted transfer; and

all information required by the section 793 notice, in a form satisfactory to the Board, in relation to any default shares.

NOTICE TO PERSON OTHER THAN A SHAREHOLDER

Where, on the basis of information obtained from a Shareholder in respect of a share held by him, the Company issues a section 793 notice to another
person, it shall at the same time send a copy of the section 793 notice to the Shareholder, but the accidental omission to do so, or the non-receipt by
the Shareholder of the copy, does not invalidate or otherwise affect the application of Regulation 25.

INTEREST IN SHARES, FAILURE TO GIVE INFORMATION AND EXCEPTED TRANSFERS
For the purpose of Regulations 25 to 27:
28.1.1 “interested” has the same meaning as in Part 22 of the UK CA 2006;

28.1.2 reference to a person having failed to give the Company the information required by a section 793 notice, or being in default in supplying
such information, includes:

(a) reference to his having failed or refused to give all or any part of it; and

(b) reference to his having given information which he knows to be false in a material particular or having recklessly given
information which is false in a material particular; and

28.1.3 “excepted transfer” means, in relation to shares held by a Shareholder:

(a) a transfer pursuant to acceptance ofa takeover offer for the Company (within the meaning of section 428(1) of the UK Companies
Act or section 974 of the UK CA 2006, whichever is in force at the relevant date); or

(b) a transfer where the Directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a bona fide sale of the whole of the beneficial
ownership of the shares to a party unconnected with the member or with any person appearing to be interested in such shares
including any such sale made through a recognised investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000) (being a statute in force in the UK as may be amended or re-enacted from time to time) or another stock exchange outside
the United

-23-
Kingdom on which shares in the capital of the Company are normally traded. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph any
associate (as that term is defined in Section 435 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986) shall be included amongst the persons who are
connected with the member or any person appearing to be interested in such shares.

28.2 Regulations 25 to 28 are in addition to and without prejudice to the BVI Companies Act.
