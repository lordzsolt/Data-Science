Shares held by that person.

1.6 Shares in a particular class shall not form a separate class of Shares from other Shares in that
class because they are dealt with as Depositary Interests.

2.1

2.2

2.3

Subject to Article 3, the Act, the requirements of (to the extent applicable) the AIM Rules and/or
the London Stock Exchange, and these Articles, every person whose name is entered as a
Member in the Company's register of Members, being the holder of registered Shares, shall

the registered agent of the Company is authorised. to affix to such certificate) with or without the
signature of any Director or-officer of the Company specifying the Share or Shares held and the

Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate and delivery of a certificate for a
Share to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.

chargee whose interest has been noted on the Company's. register of Members, be renewed on
production of the worn out certificate, or on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such
indemnity as the Directors may reasonably require... Any Member receiving a Share certificate
shall indemnify and hold the Company and its officers harmless from any loss or liability which it
or they may incur by reason of wrongful or fraudulent use or representation made by any person
by virtue of the possession of such a certificate.

3 Uncertificated Shares

Uncertificated Shares and CREST Arrangements

3.1

3.2

The Board may resolve that a class of Shares is to become, or is to cease to be, a Participating
Security. Where any class of Shares is for the time being admitted to settlement by means of the
CREST system, such securities may be issued in uncertificated form in accordance with the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations.

Shares of a class shall not be treated as forming a separate class from other Shares of the same
class as a consequence of such Shares being held in certificated or uncertificated form or of any
3.3

3.4

3.5

3.6

3.7

3.8

3.9

provision in these Articles or the Uncertificated Securities Regulations applying only to certificated
Shares or to uncertificated Shares.

Any Share of a class which is a Participating Security may be changed from an uncertificated
Share to a certificated Share and from a certificated Share to an uncertificated Share in
accordance with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations.

These Articles apply to uncertificated Shares of a class which is a Participating Security only to
the extent that these Articles are consistent with the holding of such Shares in uncertificated form,
with the transfer of title to such Shares by means of the Uncertificated System and with the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations.

The Company will, for every Member who makes a request to receive their Shares in
uncertificated form, arrange for CRESTCo (or such other clearing system as the Directors may
from time to time determine) to credit the appropriate stock amounts in CREST of the Members
concerned with their respective entitlements for Shares. The Shares will be delivered through the
CREST system and no Share certificate will be issued to the relevant Shareholder.

The Board may lay down regulations not included in these Articles which (in addition to or in
substitution for any provisions in-these Articles):

(a) apply to the issue, holding or transfer of uncertificated Shares;

(6) set out (where appropriate) the procedures for conversion and/or redemption of
uncertificated Shares; and/or

(c) the Board considers necessary or appropriate to ensure that these Articles are consistent
with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations and/or the Operator’s rules and practices.

Such regulations will apply instead of any relevant provisions in these Articles which relate to
certificates and the transfer, conversion and redemption of Shares or which are not consistent
with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations, in all cases to the extent (if any) stated in such
regulations. If the Board makes any such regulations, paragraph 3.4 of this Article will (for the
avoidance of doubt) continue to apply to these Articles, when read in conjunction with those
regulations.

Any instruction given by means of an Uncertificated System as referred to in these Articles shall
be a dematerialised instruction given in accordance with the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations, the facilities and requirements of the Uncertificated System and the Operator’s rules
and practices.

Unless the Board otherwise determine, securities held by the same Member or joint Member in
both certificated form and uncertificated form shall be treated as separate holdings.
3.10

4

4.1

Where the Company is entitled under the Operator's rules and practices, these Articles or
otherwise to dispose of, forfeit, enforce a lien over or sell or otherwise procure the sale of any
Shares of a class which is a Participating Security which are held in uncertificated form, the Board
may take such steps (subject to the Uncertificated Securities Regulations and to such rules and
practices) as may be required or appropriate, by instruction by means of the Uncertificated
System or otherwise, to effect such disposal, forfeiture, enforcement or sale including by (without
limitation):

(a)

requesting or requiring the deletion of any computer-based entries in the Uncertificated
System relating to the holding of such Shares in uncertificated form;

altering such computer-based entries so as to divest the holder of such Shares of the
power to transfer such Shares other than to a person selected or approved by the
Company for the purpose of such transfer;

requiring any holder of such Shares, by notice in writing to him, to change his holding of
such uncertificated Shares into certificated form within any specified period;

requiring any holder of such Shares*to take such steps as may be necessary to sell or
transfer such Shares as directed by the Company;

otherwise rectify or change the Register of Members. in respect of any such Shares in
such manner asthe Board considers appropriate (including, without limitation, by
entering the name of a transferee.into the Register of Members as the next holder of
such Shares);

appointing any person to take any steps in the name of any holder of such Shares as may
be required to change such Shares from uncertificated form to certificated form and/or to
effect the transfer of such Shares (and such steps shall be effective as if they had been
taken by such holder); and/or

take such other action as may be necessary to enable those Shares to be registered in
the name of the person to whom the Shares have been sold or disposed of or as
directed by him.

(e) if any offer Shares remain unallocated after the offer, the Directors shall be entitled to
issue, grant options over or otherwise dispose of those Shares to such persons on such
terms and in such manner as they think fit save that those Shares shall not be disposed
of on terms which are more favourable to their subscribers than the terms on which they
were offered to the relevant Member,

except that this Article shall not apply to Shares which are issued as bonus Shares or in
connection with an employee Share scheme or to Shares allotted in accordance with Articles 4.1
and 4.2.

Subject to the provisions of the Act in this regard, Shares may be issued on the terms that they
are redeemable, or at the option of the Company be liable to be redeemed on such terms and in
such manner as the Directors before or at the time of the issue of such Shares may determine.
4.5

4.6

4.7

The Company may issue bonus Shares, partly paid Shares and nil paid Shares.
The Directors may redeem any Share issued by the Company at a premium.

Except as required by the Act, and notwithstanding that a Share certificate may refer to a Member
holding Shares "as trustee" or similar expression, no person shall be recognised by the Company
as holding any Share upon any trust, and the Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in
any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or
partial interest in any Share or any interest in any fractional part of a Share or (except as provided
by these Articles or by the Act) any other rights in respect of any Share except any absolute right
to the entirety thereof by the registered holder.

Disclosure of interests in Shares

Notification of voting rights

5.1

5.2

5.3

5.4

If at any time the Company shall have any of its Shares admitted to trading on AIM, the provisions
of Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (as amended from time to time) of the UK
Financial Services Authority Handbook (“DTR 5”) relating to the disclosure of voting rights shall
apply to the Company, its Shares and persons interested in those Shares as if the Company were
an “issuer” for the purposes of DTR 5 and as if the provisions of DTR 5 were set out in full herein
and accordingly the vote holder and issuer notification rules set out in DTR 5 shall apply to the
Company and each holder of Shares in the Company.

A Member shall, to the extent he is lawfully able to do so, comply with the requirements of DTR 5.

If it shall come to the notice of the Directors that any Member has not, within the requisite period,
made or, as the case may be, procured the making of any notification required by Article 5.1 and
5.2, the Company may (at the absolute discretion of the Directors) at any time thereafter by notice
(for the purposes of Articles 5.1 to 5.13 inclusive, a “restriction notice”) to such Member direct
that, in respect of the Shares in relation to which the default has occurred (for the purposes of
Articles 5.1 to 5.13 inclusive, the “default Shares” which expression shall include any further
Shares which are issued in respect of any default Shares), the Member shall not be entitled to be
present or to vote on any question, either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting of the
Company or separate general meeting of the holders of any class of Shares, or to be reckoned in
a quorum.

Where the default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent of the issued Shares of the same class
as the default Shares, then the restriction notice may also direct that:

(a) any dividend or any part thereof or other monies which would otherwise be payable on or
in respect of the default Shares shall be withheld by the Company; shall not bear
interest against the Company; and shall be payable (when the restriction notice ceases
to have effect) to the person who would but for the restriction notice have been entitled
to them; and/or
5.5

5.6

5.7

(6) where an offer of the right to elect to receive Shares instead of cash in respect of any
dividend or part thereof is or has been made by the Company, any election made
thereunder by such Member in respect of such default Shares shall not be effective;
and/or

(c) no transfer of any of the Shares held by such Member shall be recognised or registered
by the Directors unless:

(i) the transfer is a permitted transfer; or

(ii) | the Member is not himself in default as regards supplying the requisite information
required under Article 5.1 and 5.2 and, when presented for registration, the
transfer is accompanied by a certificate by the Member in a form satisfactory to
the Directors to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the Member is
satisfied that none of the Shares the subject of the transfer are default Shares.

Upon the giving of a restriction notice its.terms shall apply accordingly.

The Company shall send a copy of.the restriction notice. to each other person appearing to be
interested in the Shares the subject of such-notice, but the failure or omission by the Company to
do so shall not invalidate such notice.

Any restriction notice shall have effect in accordance with its terms until not more than seven
days after the Directors are satisfied that the default in respect of which the restriction notice was
issued no longer continues but shall cease to have effect in relation to any Shares which are
validly transferred by such Member pursuant to Article 5.4(c). The Company may (at the absolute
discretion of the Directors) at any time give notice to the Member cancelling, or suspending for a
stated period the operation of, a restriction notice in whole or in part.

Notwithstanding the time limits for disclosure set out in DTR 5, the Company is required by Rule
17 of the AIM Rules to announce via a Regulatory Information Service, all the information
contained in any vote holder notification “without delay”.

Power of the Company to investigate interests in Shares

5.8

For the purposes of Articles 5.8 to 5.19 inclusive:

(a) “Relevant Shares” means the Company’s issued Shares of any class carrying rights to
vote in all circumstances at general meetings of the Company; and for the avoidance of
doubt (a) where the Company’s authorised Shares are divided into different classes of
Shares, references to Relevant Shares are to the issued Shares of each such class
taken separately and (b) any adjustment or restriction of voting rights (whether
temporary or otherwise) in respect of Shares of any such class does not affect the
application of Articles 5.8 to 5.19 inclusive in relation to interests in those or any other
Shares comprised in that class;
(b)

“interest” means, in relation to the Relevant Shares, any interest of any kind whatsoever
in any Shares comprised therein (disregarding any restraints or restrictions to which the
exercise of any right attached to the interest in the Share is, or may be, subject) and
without limiting the meaning of “interest” a person shall be taken to have an interest in a
Share if:

(i) he enters into a contract for its purchase by him (whether for cash or other
consideration); or

(ii) | not being the registered holder, he is entitled to exercise any right conferred by the
holding of the Share or is entitled to control the exercise or non-exercise of any
such right (and for these purposes a person is entitled to exercise or control the
exercise of a right conferred by the holding of Shares if he has a right (whether
subject to conditions or not) the exercise of which would make him so entitled, or
is under an obligation (whether subject to conditions or not) the fulfilment of which
would make him so entitled); or

(iil) he is a beneficiary of.a trust where the property held on trust includes an interest
in the Share; or

(iv) he has a right to call for delivery of the Share to himself or to his order; or

(v) he has a right to acquire an interest in the Share or is under an obligation to take
an interest in the Share; or

(vi) he has aright to subscribe for the Share,

whether in any case the contract, right or obligation is absolute or conditional, legally
enforceable or not and evidenced in writing or not, and it shall be immaterial that a Share
in which a person has an interest is unidentifiable. Persons having a joint interest are
treated as each having that interest;

a person is taken to be interested in any Shares in which his spouse or civil partner or any
infant child or step-child of his is interested; and ‘infant’ means a person under the age
of 18 years;

a person is taken to be interested in Shares if a body corporate is interested in them and:

(i) | that body or its Directors are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions; or

(ii) he is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of one-third or more of the voting
power at general meetings of that body,
5.9

and for the purposes of this paragraph (d) a person is treated as entitled to exercise or
control the exercise of voting power if:

(iii) | another body corporate is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of that voting
power, and he is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of one-third or more of
the voting power at general meetings of that body corporate; or

(iv) he has a right (whether or not subject to conditions) the exercise of which would
make him so entitled, or he is under an obligation (whether or not subject to
conditions) the fulfilment of which would make him so entitled; and

(e) an interest in Shares may arise from an agreement between two or more persons that
includes provision for the acquisition by any one or more of them of interests in Shares.
Articles 5.8 to 5.19 apply to such an interest if:

(i) the agreement includes provision imposing obligations or restrictions on any one
or more of the parties to. it with.respect to their use, retention or disposal of their
interests in the Shares acquired in pursuance of the agreement (whether or not
together with any other.interests of theirs in the Shares to which the agreement
relates); and

(ii) | an interest in the Company’s Shares is in fact acquired by any of the parties in
pursuance of the agreement,

and the reference above to the “use of” interests in Shares is to the exercise of any rights
or of any control or influence arising from those interests (including the right to enter into
an agreement for the exercise, or for control of the exercise, of any of those rights by
another person). Once an interest in Shares has been acquired in pursuance of the
agreement, Articles 5.8 to 5.19 continue to apply to the agreement so long as the
agreement continues to include.provisions of any description mentioned above. This
applies irrespective of whether or not any further acquisitions of interests in the Shares
take place in pursuance of the agreement, any change in the persons who are for the
time being parties to it or any variation of the agreement. References in this paragraph (e)
to the agreement include any agreement having effect (whether directly or indirectly) in
substitution for the original agreement, and “agreement” includes any agreement or
arrangement and references to provisions of an agreement include undertakings,
expectations or understandings operative under an arrangement, and any provision
whether express or implied and whether absolute or not. This paragraph (e) does not
apply to an agreement that is not legally binding unless it involves mutuality in the
undertakings, expectations or understandings of the parties to it; or to an agreement to
underwrite or sub-underwrite an offer of Shares, provided the agreement is confined to
that purpose and any matters incidental to it.

Each party to an agreement to which Article 5.8(e) applies is treated as interested in all Shares in
which any other party to the agreement is interested apart from the agreement (whether or not
the interest of the other party was acquired, or includes any interest that was acquired, in
pursuance of the agreement). For those purposes an interest of a party to such an agreement in

20
5.10

5.11

Shares is an interest apart from the agreement if he is interested in those Shares otherwise than
by virtue of the application of Article 5.8(e) (and this Article 5.9) in relation to the agreement.
Accordingly, any such interest of the person (apart from the agreement) includes for those
purposes any interest treated as his under Article 5.8 (c) or (d) (family or corporate interests) or
by the application of section Article 5.8(e) (and this Article 5.9) in relation to any other agreement
with respect to Shares to which he is a party. A notification with respect to his interest in Shares
made to the Company under Article 5.11 by a person who is for the time being a party to an
agreement to which section Article 5.8(e) applies must:

(a) state that the person making the notification is a party to such an agreement;

(6) include the names and (so far as known to him) the addresses of the other parties to the
agreement, identifying them as such; and

(c) state whether or not any of the Shares to which the notification relates are Shares in
which he is interested by virtue of Article 5.8(e) (and this Article 5.9) and, if so, the
number of those Shares.

The provisions of Articles 5.8,to.5.9 inclusive are in addition to, and separate from, any other
rights or obligations arising, at law.or otherwise. The Company may by notice in writing request
any person whom the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be interested or, at
any time during the three years immediately preceding the date on which the notice is issued, to
have been interested, in Shares comprised in the Relevant Shares:

(a) to confirm that fact or (as the case may be) to state whether or not it is the case; and

(6) — if he holds, or has during that time held, any such interest, to give such further information
as may be requested in accordance with this Article 5.

A notice under Article 5.10 may require the person to whom it is addressed:

(a) to give particulars of his own past or present interest in Shares comprised in the Relevant
Shares (held by him at any time during the three year period mentioned in Article 5.10);

(6) where the interest is a present interest and any other interest in the Shares subsists or, in
any case, where another interest in the Shares subsisted during that three (3) year
period at any time when his own interest subsisted, to give (so far as lies within his
knowledge) such particulars with respect to that other interest as may be requested by
the notice including (without limitation):

(i) the identity of persons interested in the Shares in question; and

(ii) | whether persons interested in the same Shares are or were parties to an
agreement or arrangement relating to either the acquisition by one or more of

21
5.12

5.13

them of interests in Shares or the exercise of any rights conferred by the holding
of the Shares; and

(c) where his interest is a past interest, to give (so far as lies within his knowledge)
particulars of the identity of the person who held that interest immediately upon his
ceasing to hold it.

A notice under Article 5.10 shall request any information given in response to the notice to be
given in writing within such time as may be specified in the notice, being a period of not less than
fourteen (14) days following service thereof.

The provisions of Articles 5.8 to 5.19 inclusive apply in relation to a person who has or previously
had, or is or was entitled to acquire, a right to subscribe for Shares which would on issue be
comprised in Relevant Shares as it applies in relation to a person who is or was interested in
Shares so comprised; and references above in this section to an interest in Shares so comprised
and to Shares so comprised are to be read accordingly in any such case as including respectively
any such right and Shares which would on issue be so comprised.

Failure to comply with notification requirements or a request notice

5.14

5.15

Subject to the provisions of Articles 5.18 and 5.19, if any Member, or any other person appearing
to the Directors to be interested in any Shares held by such.Member, has been served with a
request notice under Article 5.9 and does not within the fourteen (14) day period prescribed
therein supply to the Company the information thereby requested, in each case the Company
may (at the absolute discretion of the Directors) at any time thereafter by notice (for the purposes
of Articles 5.14 to 5.17 inclusive, a “restriction notice”) to such Member direct that, in respect of
the Shares in relation to which the default has occurred (for the purposes of Articles 5.14 to 5.17
inclusive, the “default Shares ” which expression shall include any further Shares which are
issued in respect of any default Shares), the Member shail not be entitled to be present or to vote
on any question, either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting of the Company or separate
general meeting of the holders of any class of Shares, or to be reckoned in a quorum.

Where the default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent of the issued Shares of the same class
as the default Shares, then the restriction notice may also direct that:

(a) any dividend or any part thereof or other monies which would otherwise be payable on or
in respect of the default Shares shall be withheld by the Company, shall not bear
interest against the Company, and shall be payable (when the restriction notice ceases
to have effect) to the person who would but for the restriction notice have been entitled
to them; and/or

(6) where an offer of the right to elect to receive Shares instead of cash in respect of any
dividend or part thereof is or has been made by the Company, any election made
thereunder by such Member in respect of such default Shares shall not be effective;
and/or

22
(c) no transfer of any of the Shares held by such Member shall be recognised or registered
by the Directors unless:

(i) the transfer is a permitted transfer; or

(ii) | the Member is not himself in default as regards supplying the requisite information
required under Article 5.1, 5.2 or 5.8 to 5.19 inclusive and, when presented for
registration, the transfer is accompanied by a certificate by the Member in a form
satisfactory to the Directors to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the
Member is satisfied that none of the Shares the subject of the transfer are default
Shares.

Upon the giving of a restriction notice its terms shall apply accordingly.

5.16 The Company shall send a copy of the restriction notice to each other person appearing to be
interested in the Shares the subject of such notice, but the failure or omission by the Company to
do so shall not invalidate such notice:

5.17 Any restriction notice shall have effect in accordance with its terms until not more than seven (7)
days after the Directors are satisfied that the default in respect of which the restriction notice was
issued no longer continues but shall cease to have effect.in relation to any Shares which are
transferred by such Member in accordance with Article 5.15(c) above on receipt by the Company
of notice that a transfer as aforesaid has been made. The Company may (at the absolute
discretion of the Directors) at any time give notice to the Member cancelling, or suspending for a
stated period the operation of, a restriction notice in whole or in part.

5.18 For the purposes of Articles 5.8 to 5.19 inclusive a person shall be treated as appearing to be
interested in any Shares if:

(a) the Member holding such Shares has given to the Company a notification whether
following service of a notice under Article 5.8 to 5.18 inclusive or otherwise which names
such person as being so interested; or

(6) after taking into account any such notification as is referred to in paragraph (a) above or
any other relevant information in the possession of the Company the Directors know or
have reasonable cause to believe that the person in question is or may be interested in
the Shares.

5.19 For the purposes of Articles 5.1, 5.2 or 5.8 to 5.18 inclusive, a transfer of Shares is a “permitted
transfer” if but only if:

(a) it is a transfer by way of, or in pursuance of, acceptance of a takeover offer for the
Company meaning an offer to acquire all the Shares, or all the Shares of any class or
classes, (other than Shares which at the date of the offer are already held by the offeror
or persons acting in concert with the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the

23
same in relation to all the Shares to which the offer relates or, where those Shares
include Shares of different classes, in relation to all the Shares of each class; or

(6) the Directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a bona fide sale of the
whole of the beneficial ownership of the Shares to a third party not connected with the
transferring Member or with any other person appearing to the Directors to be interested
in such Shares.

5.20 The Company shall maintain a register of interested parties pursuant to the provisions of these
Articles and whenever in pursuance of a requirement imposed on a Member as aforesaid the
Company is informed of an interested party, the identity of the interested party and the nature of
the interest shall be promptly inscribed therein together with the date of the request. The register
kept under this Article must be kept available for inspection at the registered office and must be
open to inspection by any person without charge. Any person is entitled, on request and on
payment of such reasonable fee as the Directors may prescribe, to be provided with a copy of
any entry in the register. A request to inspect or obtain a copy of the register must contain the
following information:

(a) in the case of an individual, his name and address;

(6) in the case of an organisation, the name and address of an individual responsible for
making the request-on behalf of the organisation;

(c) the purpose for which the information.is to be used; and
(d) whether the information will be disclosed to any other person, and if so:
(i) where that person is an individual; his name and address;

(li) | where that person is an organisation, the name and address of an individual
responsible for receiving the information on its behalf; and

(iii) | the purpose for which the information is to be used by that person.

Notification of Directors’ transfers

5.21 In order to enable the Company to comply with its obligations under Rule 17 of the AIM Rules,
any Member who is a Director shall notify the Company immediately of all “deals” (as that term is
defined in the AIM Rules) in relation to Shares of the Directors and Members of their “family” (as

that term is defined in the AIM Rules), notifying the Company of all the information required to be
disclosed under Schedule 5 to the AIM Rules.

6 Lien on Shares

Nature and scope of lien

24
6.1 The Company has a first and paramount lien on all Shares (whether Fully Paid or not) registered
in the name of a Member (whether solely or jointly with others). The lien is for all moneys payable
to the Company by the Member or the Member's estate:

(a) either alone or jointly with any other person, whether or not that other person is a
Member; and

(6) whether or not those moneys are presently payable.

this Article.

Company may sell Shares to satisfy lien

met:

(a) | the sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable;

(6) the Company gives notice to the Member holding the Share (or to the person entitled to it
in consequence of-the death or bankruptcy of that Member) demanding payment and
stating that if the notice is not complied with the Shares may be sold; and

(c) that sum is not paid within fourteen (14) Clear Days after that notice is deemed to be
given under these Articles.

6.4 The Shares may be sold in such manner as the Board determines.

Member concerned in respect of the sale.

(ob) that person shall deliver to the Company for cancellation the certificate (if any) for those
Shares.

Despite this, that person shall remain liable to the Company for all monies which, at the date of
sale, were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of those Shares. That person
shall also be liable to pay interest on those monies from the date of sale until payment at the rate
at which interest was payable before that.sale-or, failing that, at the Default Rate. The Board may
waive payment wholly or in part.or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the
Shares at the time of sale or for any consideration received.on their disposal.

Application of proceeds of sale
6.8 The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in payment of so much

of the sum for which the lien exists as is presently payable. Any residue shall be paid to the
person whose Shares have been sold:

(a) if no certificate for the Shares was issued, at the date of the sale; or

(ob) if a certificate for the Shares was issued, upon surrender to the Company of that
certificate for cancellation,

but, in either case, subject to the Company retaining a like lien for all sums not presently payable
as existed on the Shares before the sale.

7 Calls on and forfeiture of Shares

Power to make calls and effect of calls

7.1 Subject to the terms of allotment, the Board may make calls on the Members in respect of any

notice be forfeited. The forfeiture shall include the forfeiture of all dividends or other moneys
payable to the relevant Member in.respect,of the forfeited Share and not paid before the
forfeiture. Despite the foregoing, the Board may, with the written consent or at the written request
of the relevant Member, determine that any Share the subject of that notice be accepted by the
Company as surrendered by the Member holding that Share in lieu of forfeiture.

Disposal of forfeited or surrendered Share and power to cancel forfeiture or surrender

7.13 A forfeited or surrendered Share may be cancelled, or (subject to the Act) held as a treasury
share and sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the

(c) if the Share is represented by a Depositary Interest, exercise any of the Company's
powers under Article 3 to effect the sale of the Share to, or in accordance with the

Registered Shares in the Company shall be transferred:

(a) in the case of certificated Shares, by a written instrument of transfer signed by the
transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. The instrument of
transfer shall also be signed by the transferee if registration as a holder of the Shares

such transfer Is:

Members;

transfer of any renounceable right of allotment of a Share which is a Participating Security held in
uncertificated form in accordance with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations, except that the
Board may refuse (Subject to any relevant requirements of (to the extent applicable) the AIM
Rules and/or the London Stock Exchange) to register any such transfer or renunciation which is

30
in favour of more than four persons jointly or in any other circumstance permitted by the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations.

8.5 If the Board refuses to register any such transfer or renunciation the Company shall, within two

9 Takeover provisions

9.1 The provisions of Articles 9.2 to 9.16 shall apply to the Company unless the Takeover Panel has
advised the Company (or a financial adviser to the Company) that the Company is subject to the
Takeover Code at the applicable time.

9.2 Subject to Articles 9.13 to 9.15, except with the consent of a Resolution of Independent
Shareholders (as defined hereinafter) on a poll, when:

(a) | any Member (or person acting in concert with such Member) acquires, whether in a single
transaction or by a series of transactions over a period of time, an interest in Shares
which (taken together with Shares in which such Member or persons acting in concert
with such Member are interested) carry 30% or more of the voting rights of the
Company; or

31
9.3

9.4

9.5

9.6

(6) | any Member, together with persons acting in concert with such Member, is interested in
Shares which in the aggregate carry not less than 30% of the voting rights of the
Company but does not hold Shares carrying more than 50% of such voting rights and
such Member, or any person acting in concert with such Member, acquires an interest in
any other Shares which increases the percentage of Shares carrying voting rights in
which he is interested,

such Member (the “Offeror”) shall extend an offer, on the basis set out in Articles 9.3 to 9.6, to
the holders of all the issued (and to be issued) Shares in the Company. An offer will not be
required under this Article 9.2 where control of the Company is acquired as a result of a
voluntary offer made materially in accordance with the provisions of the Takeover Code (as if
the Takeover Code applied to the Company) to all holders of Shares. An offer will not be
required under this Article 9.2 as a result of the acquisition by a person of Shares upon the
Company’s original admission to AIM or as a result of the exercise by a person (or, in respect of
a corporate entity, a Member of that corporate entity’s Group) of warrants or options which were
granted to such person upon the Company’s original admission to AIM. For the purposes of this
Article 9.2 “Group” in relation to a corporate entity means that corporate entity’s subsidiaries, its
holding company and any subsidiaries of such holding company.

An offer made pursuant to Article 9.2 must be conditional only upon the Offeror having received
acceptances in respect of Shares which, together with.Shares acquired or agreed to be acquired
before or during the offer, will result in the Offeror and any person acting in concert with it holding
Shares carrying more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company.

An offer made pursuant to Article 9.2 must be in cash or be accompanied by a cash alternative at
not less than the highest price paid by the Offeror or any person acting in concert with it for any
interest in Shares during the 12 months prior to the date upon which an announcement of that
offer would have been required had the Takeover Code applied to the Company. If, after the
obligation to make an offer pursuant to Article 9.2 arises and before the offer closes for
acceptance, the Offeror or any person acting in concert with it acquires any interest in Shares at
above the offer price, it shall increase its offer to not less than the highest price paid for the
interest in Shares so acquired. The cash offer or the cash alternative must remain open after the
offer has become or been declared unconditional as to acceptances for not less than fourteen
(14) days after the date on which it would otherwise have expired.

When an offer is made pursuant to Article 9.2 and the Company has convertible securities
outstanding, the Offeror must make an appropriate offer or proposal, on terms equivalent to the
offer made for Shares, to the holders of such convertible securities to ensure that their interests
are safeguarded.

Any offer required to be made pursuant to Article 9.2 shall be made on terms that would be
required by the then current Takeover Code, save to the extent that the Board otherwise
determines. In relation to any offer required to be made pursuant to Article 9.2, any matter which
under the Takeover Code would fall to be determined by the Takeover Panel shall be determined
by the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to make such
determination.

32
9.7

9.8

9.9

9.10

9.11

9.12

No acquisition of any interest in Shares which would give rise to a requirement for an offer
pursuant to Article 9.2 may be made (and the Directors shall be entitled to refuse to register any
transfer of Shares effecting such acquisition) if the making or implementation of such offer would
or might be dependent on the passing of a resolution at any meeting of Shareholders of the
Offeror or upon any other conditions, consents or arrangements.

No nominee of an Offeror or persons acting in concert with it may be appointed as a Director, nor
may an Offeror or any persons acting in concert with it exercise the votes attaching to any Shares
until the relevant offer document has been posted.

Except with the consent of a Resolution of Independent Shareholders on a poll, Members shall
comply with the requirements of Rules 8 and 9 of the Takeover Code (as if the Takeover Code
applied to the Company) in relation to any dealings in any Shares. Any matter which under those
rules of the Takeover Code would fall to be determined by the Takeover Panel shall be
determined by the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to
make such determination. Any notice which under those rules of the Takeover Code is required to
be given to the Takeover Panel shall be given to the Company at its registered office.

Without limitation to the requirements of Article 9.9, at all times when the Company is in an offer
period each Member shall comply.with the disclosure obligations set out in Rule 8 of the
Takeover Code as if the Takeover Code applied to the Company.

If at any time any Member has incurred an obligation under Article 9.2 to extend an offer to the
holders of all the issued Shares (and any convertible securities of the Company) and shall have
failed so to do, or that any Member is in default of any other obligation imposed upon Members
pursuant to this Article 9, then the Board shall as soon as practicable by notice (a “Direction
Notice”) to such Member and any other Member acting in concert with such Member (together
the “Defaulters”) direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares held.by the Defaulters (the “Default Shares”) the Defaulters shall
not be entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy or to exercise
any other right conferred by Membership in relation to meetings of the Company;

(6) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due from
the Company on the Default Shares, whether in respect of capital or dividend or
otherwise, and the Company shall not meet any liability to pay interest on any such
payment when it is finally paid to the Member; and

(c) no other distribution shall be made on the Default Shares.

The Company shall be entitled, without the requirement to obtain the consent of any Member, to
make all such announcements as would be required or permitted under the Takeover Code (if the
Takeover Code applied to the Company), notwithstanding that such announcements may make
reference to, or contain information about, Members or persons acting in concert with Members.

9.14

9.15

9.16

Where Shares or other securities of the Company are charged as security for a loan and, as a
result of enforcement of such security, the lender incurs an obligation to make an offer under
Article 9.2, no such offer will be required if sufficient interests in Shares are disposed of within a
period of fourteen (14) days to persons unconnected with the lender, so that the percentage of
Shares carrying voting rights in which the lender, together with persons acting in concert with it, is
interested is reduced to below 30% in a manner satisfactory to the Board (in its absolute
discretion). In any case where arrangements are to be made involving a transfer of voting rights
to the lender, but which do not amount to enforcement of security, no offer under Article 9.2 will
be required if the lender satisfies the Board (in the Board’s absolute discretion) that such
arrangements are necessary to preserve the lender’s security and that the security was not given
at a time when the lender had reason to believe that enforcement was likely. A receiver, liquidator
or administrator of a company, or any other insolvency or bankruptcy official, is not required to
make an offer under Article 9.2 when he acquires an interest in Shares carrying 30% or more of
the voting rights in the Company in his capacity as such, but Article 9.2 shall for the avoidance of
doubt apply to a purchaser from such a person.

Where in the opinion of the Board the Company is in such a serious financial position that the
only way it can be saved is by an urgent rescue operation which involves the issue of new Shares
to, or the acquisition of existing Shares by, the rescuer, without approval by a Resolution of
Independent Shareholders, and which would otherwise require the rescuer to make an offer
pursuant to Article 9.2, the Board may waive the requirements of Article 9.2 in such
circumstances provided that either:

(a) approval for the rescue operation by a Resolution of Independent Shareholders on a poll
is obtained as soon as possible after the rescue operation is carried out; or

(6) some other protection for Independent Shareholders is provided which the Board
considers satisfactory in the circumstances.

If, due to a bona fide inadvertent mistake, a person incurs an obligation to make an offer under
Article 9.2, the Board may waive the requirement to make such an offer if sufficient interests in
Shares are disposed of within a limited period (being a maximum of fourteen (14) days) to
persons unconnected with such person, so that the percentage of Shares carrying voting rights in
which the person, together with persons acting in concert with him, is interested is reduced to
below 30% in a manner satisfactory to the Board.

In construing this Article 9:

(a) | the words “acting in concert”, “control”, “interests” in securities, “offer period”, “voting
rights” and any other words and expressions used in or defined in the Takeover Code
shall bear the same meanings given by the Takeover Code;

(6) “Independent Shareholders ” means the Members of the Company other than any
person who Is (or may be) obliged to make an offer pursuant to Article 9.2 and persons
acting in concert with him;

34
10

10.1

10.2

11

(c) “Resolution of Independent Shareholders” means a resolution passed by the holders
of a majority of in excess of fifty (50) percent of the votes of the Independent
Shareholders (or their duly appointed proxies) entitled to vote and voting on the
resolution either at a meeting of the Independent Shareholders;

(d) for the avoidance of doubt, a reference to a “Member” shall include a person who
becomes (or upon entry in the Register would become) a Member as a result of any
acquisition of an interest in Shares to which this Article 9 relates; and

(e) any decision to be made, or discretion to be exercised, by the Board shall be made or
exercised by the Board excluding any Director who is (or may be) obliged to make an
offer pursuant to Article 9.2 or who is acting in concert with any person who is (or may
be) obliged to make such an offer.

Mortgages of Shares and Charges over Shares
Members may mortgage or create a charge or other form of security over their Shares.

The Directors shall, at the written request of a Member who has mortgaged or created a charge
over his Shares, enter in the Company's register of Members:

(a) astatement that such Shares are mortgaged or charged;

(6) the name of the mortgagee or.chargee (where such information has been stated by the
Member); and

(c) the date on which the statement and name are.entered in the Company's register of
Members.

Transmission of Shares

Subject to sections 52(2) and 53 of the Act, the executor or administrator of a deceased Member,
the guardian of an incompetent Member or the trustee of a bankrupt Member shall be the only
person recognised by the Company as having any title to his Share, save that and only in the
event of death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Member or Members as a consequence of
which the Company no longer has any Directors or Members, then upon the production of any
documentation which is reasonable evidence of the applicant being entitled to:

(a) a grant of probate of the deceased's will, or grant of letters of administration of the
deceased's estate, or confirmation of the appointment as executor or administrator (as
the case may be, or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction), of a deceased
Member's estate;

(6) the appointment of a guardian (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of an
incompetent Member;

35
11.3

(c) the appointment as trustee (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of a
bankrupt Member; or

(d) upon production of any other reasonable evidence of the applicant's beneficial ownership
of, or entitlement to the Shares,

to the Company's registered agent in the British Virgin Islands together with (if so requested by
the registered agent) a notarised copy of the Share certificate(s) of the deceased, incompetent or
bankrupt Member, an indemnity in favour of the registered agent and/or appropriate legal advice
in respect of any document issued by a foreign court, then the administrator, executor, guardian
or trustee in bankruptcy (as the case may be) notwithstanding that their name has not been
entered in the Company's register of Members, may by written resolution of the applicant,
endorsed with written approval by the registered agent, be appointed a Director and/or entered in
the Company's register of Members as the legal and/or beneficial owner of the Shares.

Without limiting the foregoing, the production to the Company of any document which is
reasonable evidence of:

(a) a grant of probate of the will,.or grant_of letters of administration of the estate, or
confirmation of the appointment as executor (or analogous position in the relevant
jurisdiction), of a deceased Member;

(6) the appointment of-a guardian (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of an
incompetent Member;

(c) the trustee (or analogous position in the relevant jurisdiction) of a bankrupt Member; or
(d) the applicant's legal and/or beneficial ownership of the Shares,

shall be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent Member or bankrupt
Member is resident and/or domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document is issued
by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purposes of
establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the
Directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The Directors may also require an indemnity to be
given by the executor, administrator, guardian, trustee in bankruptcy or the applicant.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Member may be registered as a
Member upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Directors.
An application by any such person to be registered as a Member shall for all purposes be
deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Member and the
Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death,
incompetence or bankruptcy of any Member may, instead of being registered himself, request in

36
12

12.1

12.2

12.3

writing that some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such Share or
Shares and such request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court
having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

If the person elects to transfer the Share to another person then:
(a) if the Share is Fully Paid, the transferor must execute an instrument of transfer; and

(bo) — if the Share is partly paid, the transferor and the transferee must execute an instrument of
transfer.

If the person elects to have another person registered and the Share is represented by a
Depositary Interest, he shall take any action the Board may require (including, without limitation,
the execution of any document and the giving of any instruction by means of an Uncertificated
System) to effect transfer of the Share’to that person.

Acquisition of Own Shares

The Directors may, on behalf of the Company, subject to the written consent of all the Members
whose Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired, purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company's own Shares for such consideration as the Directors
consider fit, and either cancel or hold such Shares as treasury Shares. Shares may be
purchased or otherwise acquired in exchange for newly issued Shares in the Company.

The Directors shall not, unless permitted pursuant to the Act, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of the Company's own Shares unless immediately after such purchase, redemption
or other acquisition:

(6) the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Sections 60 and 61 of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

treasury Shares does not exceed 50% of the Shares of that class previously issued by the
Company, excluding Shares that have been cancelled.

37

conditions as they may from time to time determine subject to due compliance with the Act and
the AIM Rules.

14.2 Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Directors may, by Resolution of Directors, authorise a
distribution by the Company at a time, and of an amount, and to any Members they think fit if they
are satisfied, on reasonable grounds that, immediately after the distribution, the value of the
Company's assets will exceed the Company's liabilities and the Company is able to pay its debts
as they fall due.

14.3 No distribution shall be paid on those Shares which are held by the Company as treasury Shares
at the date of declaration of the distribution.

14.4 The Directors may, before authorising or recommending any distribution, set aside out of the
profits of the Company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at
their discretion, either be-employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such
investments as the Directors may from time to time think fit.

Declaration of dividends by Members

14.5 Subject to the provisions of the. Act, the Company.may by Resolution of Members declare
dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the Members but no dividend shall exceed
the amount recommended by the Directors.

Differing rights and fixed rate dividends

14.6 In relation to Shares carrying differing rights to dividends or rights to dividends at a fixed rate, the
following applies:

(a) If the authorised Shares are divided into different classes, the Directors may pay
dividends on Shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to
dividends as well as on Shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividends
but no dividend shall be paid on Shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at
the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrears.

(6) |The Directors may also pay, at intervals settled by them, any dividend payable at a fixed
rate if it appears to them that there are sufficient funds of the Company lawfully available
for distribution to justify the payment.

38
(c) If the Directors act in good faith, they shall not incur any liability to the Members holding
Shares conferring preferred rights for any loss those Members may suffer by the lawful
payment of the dividend on any Shares having deferred or non-preferred rights.

Apportionment of dividends

14.7 Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to Shares, all dividends shall be declared
and paid according to the amounts paid up on the Shares on which the dividend is paid. All
dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amount paid up on the Shares
during the time or part of the time in respect of which the dividend is paid. But if a Share is issued
on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, that Share shall rank for
dividend accordingly.

Right of set off

14.8 |The Directors may deduct from a dividend or any other amount payable to a person in respect of
a Share any amount due by that person-to»sthe.Company on a call or otherwise in relation to a
Share.

Power to pay other than in cash

14.9 If the Directors so determine, any resolution declaring a dividend may direct that it shall be
satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets. lf a difficulty arises in relation to the
distribution, the Directors may settle that difficulty in any way they consider appropriate. For
example, they may do any one.or more of the following:

(a) issue fractional Shares;

(6) fix the value of assets for distribution and.make cash payments to some Members on the
footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of Members; and

(c) vest some assets in trustees.

following ways:

(a) — if the Member holding that Share or other person entitled to that Share nominates a bank
account for that purpose - by wire transfer or by such other electronic means (including,
in the case of a Share represented by a Depositary Interest, a Uncertificated System) to
that bank account as the holder or person entitled to payment may notify to the
Company for the purpose; or

39
(6) by cheque or warrant sent by post to the registered address of the Member holding that
Share or other person entitled to that Share; or

(c) (in respect of any uncertificated Share) through the Uncertificated System in accordance
with any authority given to the Company to do so (whether in writing, through the
Uncertificated System or otherwise) by or on behalf of the Member in a form or in a
manner satisfactory to the Board.

14.11 For the purpose of paragraph (a) of the preceding Article, the nomination may be in writing or in
an Electronic Record and the bank account nominated may be the bank account of another
person. For the purpose of paragraph (b) of the preceding Article, subject to any applicable law or
regulation, the cheque or warrant shall be made to the order of the Member holding that Share or
other person entitled to the Share or to his nominee, whether nominated in writing or in an
Electronic Record, and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the
Company. For the purpose of paragraph (c) of the preceding Article, the Company shall not be
responsible for amounts lost or delayed in the course of transfer. If payment is made by or on
behalf of the Company through the Uncertificated System:

(a) | the Company shall not be responsible for any default in accounting for such payment to
the Member or other person entitled to such payment by a bank or other financial
intermediary of which the Member or other person is a customer for settlement purposes
in connection with the Uncertificated System; and

(6) the making of such payment in accordance with any relevant authority referred to in
paragraph (c) of the preceding Article shall be a good discharge to the Company.

14.12 The Board may:

(a) lay down procedures for making any payments in respect of uncertificated Shares through
the Uncertificated System;

(6) allow any holder of uncertificated Shares to elect to receive or not to receive any such
payment through the Uncertificated System; and

(c) lay down procedures to enable any such holder to make, vary or revoke any such
election.

14.13 If two or more persons are registered as the holders of the Share or are jointly entitled to it by
reason of the death or bankruptcy of the registered holder (“Joint Holders”), a dividend (or other
amount) payable on or in respect of that Share may be paid as follows:

(a) to the registered address of the Joint Holder of the Share who is named first on the
register of Members or to the registered address of the deceased or bankrupt holder, as
the case may be; or

40

persons entered on the Register of Membersvat the close of business on a day determined by the
Board (subject to the Uncertificated Securities Regulations if the Company is then a participating
issuer for the purpose of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations).

instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of an individual duly authorised
by such corporation or legal entity to execute the same.

may from time to time permit appointments of a proxy to be made by means of an electronic
communication in the form of an Uncertificated Proxy Instruction (as defined below). The
Directors may in a similar manner permit supplements to, or amendments or revocations of, any
such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction to be made by like means. The Directors may in addition
prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such properly authenticated
dematerialised instruction (and/or other instruction or notification) is to be treated as received by
the Company or such participant. Notwithstanding any other provision in these Articles, the
Directors may treat any such Uncertificated Proxy Instruction which purports to be or is expressed
to be sent on behalf of a Member as sufficient evidence of the authority of the person sending
that instruction to send it on behalf of the Member.

16.7 For the purpose of this Article, "Uncertificated Proxy Instruction" means properly authenticated
dematerialised instructions and/or other instruction or notification, which is sent by means of the

which it is signed (or a copy of the authority certified notarially or in any other way approved by

44
the Directors) must be delivered so that it is received by the Company forty eight (48) hours
before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the
form of appointment of proxy proposes to vote. They must be delivered in either of the following
ways:

(a) Inthe case of an instrument in writing, it must be left at or sent by post:
(i) to the registered office of the Company; or

the Company in relation to the meeting.

(bo) ‘If, pursuant to the notice provisions, a notice may be given to the Company in an
Electronic Record, an Electronic Record of an appointment of a proxy must be sent to
the address specified pursuant to those provisions unless another address for that
purpose is specified:

(i) in the notice convening the meeting; or

(ii) | in any form of appointment of a proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the
meeting; or

(iii) in any invitation to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation to the
meeting.

16.9 Where a poll is taken:

(a) if it is taken more than seven Clear Days after it is demanded, the form of appointment of
a proxy and any accompanying authority (or an Electronic Record of the same) must be
delivered as required under the preceding Article not less than forty eight (48) hours
before the time appointed for the taking of the poll;

(bo) if it to be taken within seven Clear Days after it was demanded, the form of appointment
of a proxy and any accompanying authority (or an Electronic Record of the same) must

the same Share for use at the same meeting and in respect of the same matter, the one which is
last validly delivered or received (regardless of its date or of the date of its execution) shall be
treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that Share. If the Company is

45
16.12

unable to determine which appointment was last validly delivered or received, none of them shall
be treated as valid in respect of that Share.

The Board may at the expense of the Company send forms of appointment of proxy to the
Members by post (that is to say, pre-paying and posting a letter), or by electronic communication
or otherwise (with or without provision for their return by pre-paid post) for use at any general
meeting or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of Shares, either blank or

persons specified in the invitations are issued at the Company’s expense, they shall be issued to
all (and not to some only) of the Members entitled to be sent notice of the meeting and to vote at
it. The accidental omission to send such a form of appointment or to give such an invitation to, or

meeting shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

would have had except to the extent that the instrument appointing him limits those rights.

adjourned meeting. If a Member votes on any resolution a vote by his proxy on the same
resolution, unless in respect of different Shares, shall be invalid.

The instrument appointing-a proxy to vote at a meeting shall be deemed also to confer authority
to demand or join in demanding a poll and, for the purposes of Article 14.9, a demand by a
person as proxy for a Member shall be the same as a demand by a Member. Such appointment
shall not confer any further right to speak at the meeting, except with the permission of the
chairman of the meeting.

total voting Shares issued and having the right to vote on such resolution.

Unless a poll be so demanded, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has, on a show of
hands been carried, and an entry to that effect in the book containing the minutes of the
proceedings of the Company, shall be sufficient evidence of the fact, without proof of the number
or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.

If a poll is duly demanded it shall be taken in such manner as the Chairman directs, and the result
of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.

every voting Share of which he is the holder which confers the right to a vote on the resolution.

delegation of such powers as may be authorised by these Articles and permitted by the Act and
to such requirements as may be prescribed by Resolution of the Members, but no requirement
