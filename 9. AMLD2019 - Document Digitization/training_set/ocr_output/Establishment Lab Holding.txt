shall have no obligation to pay any dividends, except when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of
any assets at the time legally available therefor or as otherwise specifically provided in this Memorandum. No
distribution shall be made with respect to other shares of the Company until all declared or accrued but unpaid
dividends on the Class G-1 Ordinary Shares have been paid or set aside for payment to the holders thereof.

For so long as any Class G-1 Ordinary shares remain outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent
required in this Memorandum or the Articles or by law, the vote or written consent of the holders of at least a

shares, consideration or otherwise):

CONVERSION

Automatic Conversion

Each Ordinary Share shall convert automatically into one Common Share (or, with respect to Class F Ordinary Shares
and Class G-1 Ordinary Shares, as such ratio may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7.3) (such ratio, the “Conversion
Ratio”) upon the earliest of:

(a)

(b)

the closing of a firm underwritten public offering of Common Shares with gross proceeds of at least US$35
million; or

such date and time as is specified by the affirmative written vote or written consent of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, Class B Ordinary Shares, Class C Ordinary Shares, Class D
Ordinary Shares, Class E Ordinary Shares, Class F Ordinary Shares and Class G Ordinary Shares voting as a
single class.

No Fractional Shares

No fractional Common Shares shall be issued upon conversion of Ordinary Shares. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the
holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value

of a share of the Company’s Common Shares, as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of the
Company’s Ordinary Shares held by each holder of Ordinary Shares shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of
Common Shares shall be paid in cash.

Adjustment for Future Equity Financings

If the Company issues equity securities in an equity financing that is not the Company’s initial public offering of
registered securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (such initial public offering, the “IPO”), for a
consideration per share (such consideration per share being referred to as the “Future Equity Financing Price”) less
than $14.00 per share, then the Conversion Ratio for each Class F Ordinary Share (or if the Class F Ordinary Shares
have been converted to Common Shares in accordance with Section 7.1(b), each such converted Common Share) shall
be equal to the quotient of (a) 14.0 divided by (b) the Future Equity Financing Price multiplied by 0.85 (the “Class F
Price Adjustment”). The Class F Price Adjustment obligation in this Section 7.3(a) shall terminate immediately upon
the closing of the IPO if such IPO consists of the closing of a firm underwritten public offering of Common Shares with
gross proceeds of at least US$35 million (a “Qualifying IPO”) but otherwise shall continue until conversion occurs
pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.3(a) or the conversion right expires in connection with Section 7.3(b).

If the Company issues equity securities in the IPO for a consideration per share (such consideration per share being
referred to as the “IPO Price”) less than $15.00 per share, then the Conversion Ratio for each Class F Ordinary Share
(or if the Class F Ordinary Shares have been converted to Common Shares in accordance with Section 7.1(b), each such
converted Common Share) shall be equal to the quotient of (a) 15.0 divided by (b) the IPO Price multiplied by 0.85 (the
“Class FIPO Price Adjustment”). The Class F IPO Price Adjustment obligation in this Section 7.3(b) shall terminate
immediately upon the closing of any IPO below $15 per share by reason of the automatic conversion set forth herein, or
upon the closing of a Qualifying IPO above $15 per share but shall continue for further public offerings if such IPO is
not a Qualifying IPO and the shares have not otherwise converted hereunder.

If the Company issues equity securities in a public offering registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(a “Public Offering”) for a price to the public (the “Public Offering Price”) of less than $17.60 per share, then the
Conversion Ratio for each Class G-1 Ordinary Share (or if the Class G-1 Ordinary Shares have been converted to
Common Shares in accordance with Section 7.1(b), each holder of such converted Common Shares shall be issued
additional Common Shares as though such increased Conversion Ratio applied at the time of such conversion) shall be
increased (but shall not be decreased hereunder) to an amount equal to the quotient of (a) 17.6 divided by (b) the Public
Offering Price multiplied by 0.90 (the “Class G-1 IPO Price Adjustment”). The Class G-1 IPO Price Adjustment
obligation in this Section 7.3(c) shall terminate immediately upon the closing of (i) any Public Offering with a Public
Offering Price below $17.60 per share pursuant to which an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio occurs under this
Section 7.3(c), or (ii) a firm-commitment underwritten Public Offering with gross proceeds of at least US$35 million,
which may be the Company’s IPO (a “Qualifying Offering”), with a Public Offering Price above $17.60 per share but
shall continue for further public offerings if the shares have not otherwise converted pursuant to the terms of Section
7.1(a).

If the Company issues equity securities in an equity financing that is not a Public Offering for a Future Equity Financing
Price less than $16.00 per share, then the Conversion Ratio for each Class G-1 Ordinary Share (or if the Class G-1
Ordinary Shares have been converted to Common Shares in accordance with Section 7.1(b), each holder of such
converted
Establishment Labs Holdings Inc.

Page 8

Common Shares shall be issued additional Common Shares as though such increased Conversion Ratio applied at the
time of such conversion) shall be increased (but shall not be decreased hereunder) to an amount equal to the quotient of
(a) 16.0 divided by (b) the Future Equity Financing Price multiplied by 0.90 (the “Class G-1 Financing Price
Adjustment”). The Class G-1 Financing Price Adjustment shall terminate immediately upon the closing of (1) any
equity financing below $16 per share pursuant to which an adjustment to the Conversion Ratio occurs under this Section
7.3(d) or (ii) a Qualifying Offering, but otherwise shall continue until conversion occurs pursuant to the terms of Section
7.1(a).

VARIATION OF CLASS RIGHTS

Subject to the Articles, the rights attached to any class or series of shares (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class or series), whether or not the Company is being wound-up, may be varied with the consent in writing of all
the holders of the issued shares of that class or series or with the sanction of a resolution passed by a majority of the votes cast
at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of the class or series.

RIGHTS NOT VARIED BY THE ISSUE OF SHARES PARI PASSU

Rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class or series issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless
otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class or series, be deemed to be varied by the creation or
issue of further shares ranking pari passu therewith.

REGISTERED SHARES

The Company shall issue registered shares only, and such shares may be in full or fractional form. The Company is not
authorised to issue bearer shares, convert registered shares to bearer shares, or exchange registered shares for bearer shares.

AMENDMENT OF MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION

Subject to Clause (a) and the Articles, the Company may amend its Memorandum or Articles by a Resolution of Members or a
Resolution of Directors, save that no amendment may be made by a Resolution of Directors:

(a) to restrict the rights or powers of the Members to amend the Memorandum or Articles;

(b) to change the percentage of Members required to pass a Resolution of Members to amend the Memorandum or Articles;
(c) in circumstances where the Memorandum or Articles cannot be amended by the Members;

(d) to clauses 6 (except where such amendment is for the purposes of setting out the rights of any new classes of shares

issued under Clause 5), 9 or this clause 11;

(e) which, by its terms, materially and adversely affects any holder of Ordinary Shares in a unique or disproportionate
manner relative to all holders of the Ordinary Shares, without the prior written consent of each such holder of Ordinary
Shares; or

determines, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form shall be the original register of members.

12.4Subject to Article 13, the Company shall, on receipt of an instrument of transfer, enter the name and address of the

transfer for reasons that shall be specified in the resolution.

12.5The Board is permitted to pass a Resolution of Directors refusing or delaying the registration of a transfer where it
reasonably determines that it is in the best interest of the Company to do so. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Board may refuse or delay the registration of a transfer of shares if the transferor has failed to pay an
amount due in respect of those shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Board may not prohibit

such Madryn Holder from such person, (B) a transfer by any Madryn Holder which is a fund pursuant to a pledge, or
grant of a security interest, to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee (provided, that in the case of clauses
(A) and (B), no pledge or grant of a security interest shall release the transferor Madryn Holder from any of its
obligations hereunder), and (C) a transfer made in connection with the Madryn Holder’s pro rata transfer of all or any
part of or interest in any loans or other indebtedness owing to any such Madryn Holder under the Credit Agreement (the

Delaware limited partnership, as the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in accordance with the
terms thereof

12.6Where the Board passes a resolution to refuse or delay the registration of a transfer, the Company shall, as soon as
practicable, send the transferor and the transferee a notice of the refusal or delay.

12.7The transfer of a share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members and the Company
shall not be required to treat a transferee of a share in the Company as a Member until the transferee’s name has
been entered in the register of members.

12.8If the Board is satisfied that an instrument of transfer has been signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, it
may resolve:

(a)to accept such evidence of the transfer of the shares as it considers appropriate; and

(b)that the transfer of shares be recorded, including by the entry of the transferee’s name in the register of members.

Lock-Up

14.1Each Key Holder hereby agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter, during the
period commencing on the date of the final prospectus relating to the Company’s IPO and ending on the date
specified by the Company and the managing underwriter (such period not to exceed 180 days), or such other period
as may be requested by the Company or an underwriter to accommodate regulatory restrictions on (1) the
publication or other distribution of research reports and (2) analyst recommendations and opinions, (including, but
not limited to, the restrictions contained in FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4) or NYSE Rule 472(f)(4), or any successor
provisions or amendments thereto) (a) lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise
transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Capital Shares held immediately prior to the effectiveness of the
registration statement for the IPO or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole
or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Capital Shares, whether any such transaction
described in (a) or (b) above is to be settled by delivery of Capital Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise.
The foregoing provisions of this Article shall not apply to the sale of any shares to an underwriter pursuant to an
underwriting agreement, and shall only be applicable to the Key Holders if all officers, directors and holders of
more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares enter into similar agreements. The underwriters in
connection with the IPO are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Article and shall have the right, power and
authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Each Key Holder further agrees to
execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters in the IPO that are consistent with this
Article or that are necessary to give further effect thereto.

as having any title to the Member’s share.

15.2Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a share in consequence of the death, incompetence or
bankruptcy of any Member may be registered as a Member upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably
be required by the Board. An application by any such person to be registered as a Member shall for all purposes be
deemed to be a transfer of the share of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Member and the Board shall treat it
as such.

15.3Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any
Member may, instead of being registered himself, request in writing that some person to be named by him be
registered as the transferee of such share and such request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.
