and containing the name and address of the transferee and, in the case of the transfer of
a Share that imposes a liability to the Company on the transferee, the instrument of

the transferee's name has been entered in the Register of Shareholders.

Subject to these Articles, the Company shall, on receipt of a duly executed instrument of
transfer, enter in the Register of Shareholders the name of the transferee of the Share(s)
unless the Directors resolve to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer for reasons
that shall be specified in the Resolution of Directors.

The registration of a transfer of Shares may be suspended and the Register of
Shareholders closed at such times and for such periods as the Company may from time
to time by Resolution of Directors determine, provided always that such registration shall
not be suspended and the Register of Shareholders shall not be closed for more than 60
days in any period of 12 months.

Where the Directors are satisfied that an instrument of transfer has been signed but that
the instrument has been lost-or destroyed, they may resolve:

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of the Shares as they consider
appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in-the Register of Shareholders,
notwithstanding the absence of the instrumeni of transfer.

Notwithstanding anything in the Memorandum or these Articles to the contrary, to the
fullest extent the Act so permits:

(a) a CREST transfer form or dematerialisation form lodged as a stock deposit (and
which has been copied.to the Company) will be deemed to constitute a transfer
of the Shares the subject thereof to the transferee identified therein; and

(b) a stock withdrawal form (which has been copied to the Company) will be deemed
to constitute a transfer of the Shares the subject thereof to the transferee
identified therein,

and any such deemed transfer under any of Articles 29A(a) and (b) above will be
effective when the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of Shareholders.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

incompetent Shareholder, the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder or liquidator or
administrator or receiver of an insolvent Shareholder shall be the only person recognised
by the Company as having any title to the Shares of that Shareholder but none of them
shall be entitled to exercise any rights as a Shareholder until they have complied with the
procedures set out in the next following two Regulations.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be
32.

33.

34.

registered as a Shareholder upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be
required by the Directors. An application by any such person to be registered as a
Shareholder shall be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the deceased, incompetent or
bankrupt Shareholder and the Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death,
incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself,
request in writing that some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee
of such Share or Shares and such request shall likewise be treated as if it were a
transfer.

the court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

acquires or disposes of his interest in Relevant Shares; or

knows that any other person has acquired or disposed of an interest in Relevant
Shares; or

becomes aware of any other change in circumstances affecting his or any other
person’s interest in any Relevant Shares,

then, if the circumstances set out in Regulation 44 applies, the Shareholder shall become
obliged to notify the Company of his interests (if any) in the Relevant Shares, and to the
extent he is aware of such further information and is not prevented by applicable law from
disclosing the same, to notify the Company of the interests of any other person in the
Relevant Shares. If in any case the Shareholder is prevented by applicable law from
disclosing information in relation to any other person pursuant to these Regulations, the
Shareholder shall use his reasonable endeavours to procure that such other person
himself notifies his interests in the Relevant Shares to the Company.
43.

44.

45.

46.

47.

The circumstances in which the Shareholder is obliged to notify the Company of matters
relating to interests in Relevant Shares pursuant to Regulation 42 are where:

(a) the Shareholder or any other person has a notifiable interest in Relevant Shares
immediately after the relevant acquisition or disposal, but did not have such an
interest immediately before that time.

(b) the Shareholder or any other person has a notifiable interest in Relevant Shares
immediately before the relevant acquisition or disposal, but does not have such
an interest immediately after it; or

(c) the Shareholder or any other person has a notifiable interest in Relevant Shares
immediately before the relevant acquisition or disposal, and has such an interest
immediately after it, but the percentage levels of his interest immediately after it
are not the same.

For the purposes of Regulation 43, “percentage level’ means the percentage figure
found by expressing the aggregate number of all the Shares comprised in the Company’s
issued share capital in which the person has an interest immediately before or (as the
case may be) immediately after the relevant acquisition or disposal (or the time when the
Shareholder became aware of any.other circumstance affecting interests in Shares) as a
percentage of the Company’s issued share capital.

Any notification required to’be, made under Regulation 43 must be made in writing to the
Company within the period of five days from the day on which that obligation arises, and,
to the extent that a Shareholder is not lawfully able to make such notification, such
Shareholder shall use his reasonable endeavours to.procure that the relevant person
notifies his interest to the Company within such five day period. The period for the
submission of any notification to the Company may be extended by the Directors at their
discretion.

The notification shall state the number of Shares (if any) in which the person making the
notification knows he (or any other relevant person) was interested at the time when the
obligation arose, and (except where the notification states that a person no longer has a
notifiable interest) such notification shall include the following particulars, so far as known
to the person making the notification at the date when it is made:

(a) the identity of each registered holder of Shares to which the notification relates
and the number of such Shares held by each of them, and, if the registered
holder is not entitled to exercise the voting rights attaching to the Shares, the
identity of the person who is entitled to exercise the voting rights on his behalf;

(b) the nature of the interests in the Relevant Shares and the chain of controlled
undertakings (if applicable) through which the voting rights are effectively held;

(c) the date on which the relevant percentage level has been reached or crossed;

(d) in the case of a person making the notification in relation to Shares in which he is
the registered owner, the change since the last notification he made regarding
his shareholding; and

(e) the resulting situation in voting rights.

Where a person authorises another (the “agent’) to acquire or dispose of, on his behalf,
interests in Shares in the Company, he shall procure that the agent notifies him
48.

49.

50.

51.

52.

immediately of acquisitions or disposals effected by the agent which will or may give rise
to any obligation of disclosure imposed by this Regulation with respect to his interest in
the Shares.

If it shall come to the notice of the Directors that any Shareholder or any person
appearing to be interested in the Shares registered in the name of any Shareholder has
not within the requisite period made, or as the case may be, procured the making of any
notification required by this Regulation, the Company may (at the absolute discretion of
the Directors) at any time thereafter by notice to any Shareholder (a “Restriction
Notice”) direct that in respect of the Shares in relation to which the default has occurred
(the “Default Shares’, which expression shall include any further Shares which are
acquired by the defaulting Shareholder) such Shares will not confer upon the
Shareholder the right to vote at any general meeting of Shareholders and/or will not
carry any right to any dividends or other distributions (whether of income or of capital).

The Company shall send a copy of the Restriction Notice to each other person appearing
to be interested in the Shares the subject of such notice but the failure or omission by the
Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice. The Company may at the absolute
discretion of the Directors at any time give notice to the Shareholder cancelling or
suspending for a stated period the operation of a Restriction Notice in whole or in part.

Any Restriction Notice shall have effect from the date of its issue until one of the following
has occurred (“relevant event”):

(a) the default is remedied to the satisfaction of the Company, and the Board notifies
the relevant Shareholder of its satisfaction; or

(b) the Shares are registered in the name of a transferee, or that of his nominee,
pursuant to an arm’s length transfer.

A person, other than the Shareholder holding a Share, shall be treated as appearing to
be interested in that Share if the Shareholder has informed the Company that the person
is or may be interested, or if the Company (after taking account of information obtained
from the Shareholder, or pursuant to a notice from anyone else) knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the person.is or maybe so interested.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may, at the absolute
discretion of the Directors, at any time give notice to any Depositary disapplying, for any
period of time and in whole or in part, the provisions of Regulations 40 to 52 in relation to
that Depositary.

Company Investigations

53.

54.

The Company may by notice in writing (a “Disclosure Notice”) require a person whom
the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be or, at any time during the
three years immediately preceding the date on which the Disclosure Notice is issued, to
have been interested in the Company’s Shares:

(a) to confirm whether or not this is the case; and
(b) where he holds or has during that time held an interest in the Company’s Shares,
to give such further information as may be required in accordance with the

following Regulation 54.

A Disclosure Notice may require the person to whom it is addressed:
55.

56.

5/7.

58.

59.

60.

(a) to give the particulars of the identity of persons interested in the Shares in
question and the nature of their interests;

(b) to give particulars of his own past or present interest in Shares in the Company
(held by him at any time during the 3-year period immediately preceding the date
on which the notice is issued); and

(c) where his interest is a past interest, to give (so far as lies within his knowledge)
particulars of the identity of the person who held that interest immediately upon
his ceasing to hold it.

A Disclosure Notice shall require any information given in response to it to be given in
writing within such reasonable time as may be specified in the Disclosure Notice but not
later than fourteen days from the issue of the Disclosure Notice.

Regulations 53 to 55 apply in relation to a person who has or previously had, or is or was
entitled to acquire, a right to subscribe for Shares in the Company as it applies in relation
to a person who is or was interested in Shares already issued; and references in
Regulations 53 to 55 above to an interest in Shares are to be read accordingly in any
such case as including respectively any such right and Shares.

If a Disclosure Notice is given to a person appearing to be interested in any Shares, a
copy will at the same time. be given to the holder of those Shares, but the accidental
omission to do so or the non-receipt by the Shareholder will not prejudice the operation of
Regulations 55 to 59, which are without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation 62.

Subject to the provisions of Regulation 59, where a Disclosure Notice is served by the
Company on a person appearing to the Directors to be, orto have been, interested in the
Shares of the Company and that person fails to give the Company any information
required by the Disclosure Notice within the specified time, the Company may (at the
discretion of the Directors) apply to Court for an order directing that the Shares in
question be subject to such restrictions as the Court believes appropriate in the
circumstances and/ or deliver a notice on the Shareholder holding the Shares in relation
to which the default has occurred (a “Default Notice’). The Default Notice shall apply to
the Shares in relation to which the default has occurred and any further Shares which are
acquired by the defaulting person (together, the “Default Shares’).

With effect from delivery of a Default Notice, unless the Directors otherwise determine, a
Shareholder will not be entitled in respect of any Shares held by him, whether or not
referred to in the Disclosure Notice:

(a) to attend and vote (including by poll) at any meeting whether personally or by
proxy,

(b) to receive any dividend or other amount payable in respect of the Shares; or

(c) subject to Regulation 61, to transfer or agree to transfer any of the Shares, or

any rights in them-

and the restrictions imposed by these Regulations in relation to any Shares will continue
until a relevant event occurs in relation to those Shares.

Any dividends or other amounts withheld pursuant to Regulation 59(b) will be paid
(without interest) to the Shareholder as soon as practicable after the restrictions
contained in Regulation 59 cease to have effect.
61.

62.

63.

64.

65.

66.

67.

The restrictions in Regulation 59 are without prejudice to the right of either the registered
or the beneficial owner of the Shares concerned, to sell or agree to sell them pursuant to
an arm’s length transfer.

Where a Disclosure Notice is served on a Depositary, and the Depositary fails, through
no fault of its own, for any reason to comply with the Disclosure Notice:

(a) the provisions of Regulations 57 to 61 will only be implemented by the Company
in relation to those Shares in respect of which there has been a failure, and will
not be implemented in relation to any other Shares in the Company held by the
Depositary; and

(b) the Company will not prevent the Shares held by the Depositary in respect of
which there has been a failure from being transferred by the Depositary to a
person shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be the beneficial holder or
holders of such Shares.

The Company may at the absolute discretion of the Directors, at any time give notice to
the Shareholder cancelling, or suspending for a stated period the operation of a Default
Notice in whole or in part.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF SHARES

Shareholders may mortgage or charge. their Shares in the Company and upon
satisfactory evidence thereof the Company shall give effect to the terms of any valid
mortgage or charge except in so far as it may conflict with any requirements herein
contained for consent to the transfer of Shares.

Shareholders of the Company:

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors consider
necessary or desirable, however, the failure to satisfy this Regulation does not invalidate
the meeting.

outstanding Shares entitled to vote in the Company on the matter for which the meeting
is being requested the Directors shall convene a meeting of Shareholders.

Shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class together with not less than
an absolute majority of the remaining votes,

have waived notice of the meeting and for this purpose presence at the meeting shall be
deemed to constitute waiver.

The inadvertent failure of the Directors to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder, or
the fact that a Shareholder has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

speak and vote on behalf of the Shareholder.

meeting before the time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such

directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its
representative at any meeting of the Company or of any class of Shareholders and the
person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the
person which he represents as that person could exercise if it were an_ individual
Shareholder.

exercising their powers or performing their duties, act in a manner which they
believe to be in the best interests of the Company’s holding company, even
though it may not be in the best interests of the Company;

Directors may, when exercising their powers or performing their duties, and with
the prior agreement of the shareholders other than the holding company, act ina
manner which they believe to,be in the best interests of the Company’s holding
company, even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company;

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

The Directors or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and
places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors may determine to be
necessary or desirable and for.the avoidance of doubt any one Director may call a

telephone or other electronic means and all Directors participating in the meeting are able
to hear each other.

A Director shall be given not less than 3 days notice of meetings of Directors, but a
meeting of Directors held without 3 days notice having been given to all Directors shall be
valid if all the Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend, waive notice of
the meeting, and for this purpose, the presence of a Director at the meeting shall be
deemed to constitute waiver on his part. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a
meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director has not received the notice, does not
invalidate the meeting.

A Director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a Director
and an alternate is entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the Director who

number of Directors, unless there are only two Directors in which case the quorum shall
be two.

If the Company shall have only one Director the provisions herein contained for meetings
of the Directors shall not apply but such sole Director shall have full power to represent
and act for the Company in all matters as are not by the Act or the Memorandum or these
Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders and in lieu of minutes of a meeting
shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a
Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum shall constitute sufficient evidence
of such resolution for all purposes.

the meeting. If there is no chairman of the Board or if the chairman of the Board is not
present at the meeting the vice chairman of the Board shall preside. If there is no vice

investigative proceedings any person (an."Indemnifiable Person") who:

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending

person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, is in the
absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of these Articles, unless a question of law is
involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgement, order, settlement, conviction or

interests of the Company or that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful.

If a person to be indemnified has been successful in defence of any proceedings
