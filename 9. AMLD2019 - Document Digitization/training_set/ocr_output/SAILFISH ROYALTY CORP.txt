other Director.

places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Board may determine to be
necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no meeting of the Board or any

committee of Directors may be held in Canada.

A Director is deemed to be present at a meeting of the Board if he participates by
telephone or other electronic means and all Directors participating in the meeting are able
to hear each other; provided, however, that if 50% or more of the Directors would be so
participating while physically present in Canada, such meeting shall be automatically
adjourned and no business conducted, until such meeting can be re-convened in
circumstances where a majority of directors participating in such meeting are not

physically present in Canada.

the meeting there are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total
number of Directors, unless there are only 2 Directors in which case the quorum is 2; and
(ii) a majority of the Directors present in person or by alternate are neither physically

present in Canada at such time nor ordinarily resident in Canada.

If the Company has only one Director the provisions herein contained for meetings of the
Board do not apply and-such sole Director has full power to represent and act for the
Company in all matters as are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required
to be exercised bythe Shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting, the sole Director
shall record in writing and signa note or memorandum of all matters requiring a
Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of

such resolution for all purposes.

as chairman of the meeting. If thereis no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of
the Board is not present, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to be

chairman of the meeting.

also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of Directors
consented to in writing by all Directors or by all members of the committee, as the case
may be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts
each counterpart being signed by one or more Directors. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take
effect on the date upon which the last Director has consented to the resolution by signed
counterparts. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Article 10.9, no action may be taken

by consent and no such Resolution of Directors shall be valid unless a majority of
- 2] -

counterparts are signed by Directors while such Directors are not physically present in

capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint

venture, trust or other enterprise.

Company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity
