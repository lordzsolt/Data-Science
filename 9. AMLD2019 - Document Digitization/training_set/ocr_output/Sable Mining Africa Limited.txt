of any share or any interest in any fractional part of a share other than an absolute
right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.

shares in respect of whom the Company is not by law required to complete and have

fulfilment or discharge thereof shall have actually arrived or not and such lien shall
extend to all dividends from time to time declared in respect of such shares and to

all calls and instalments in respect thereof.

respect of a share is not paid, the person from whom the same is due shall pay
interest on the amount of the call or instalment at such rate not exceeding 15 per
cent. per annum as the Board shall fix from the day appointed for payment thereof
to the time of actual payment, but the Board may waive payment of such interest
wholly or in part.

General Meeting either personally or (save as proxy for another Member) by proxy,

him, whether alone or jointly with any other person, together with interest and
expenses (if any).

provisions of these Articles as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture and
the like, and all other relevant provisions of these Articles, shall apply as if such
sum were a call duly made and notified.

difference between the holders of such shares in the amount of calls to be paid and
in the time of payment of such calls.

The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the
same all or any part of the moneys due on his shares beyond the sums actually

agreed between it and such Member, in addition to the dividend payable upon such
part of the share in respect of which such advance has been made as is actually
called up: Provided that no dividend shall be payable on so much of the moneys
paid up on a share as exceeds the amount for the time being called up thereon. The
Board may at any time repay the amount so advanced on giving to such Member not
less than three months' notice in writing of its intention in that behalf, unless before
the expiration of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been called up on
the share in respect of which it was advanced.

any liability of a person for causing or permitting a dematerialised

instruction:

(i) to be sent without authority;

(ii) to contain information that is incorrect; or

(iii) to be expressed to have been sent by a person who did not send

Articles 33(N) to 33(P) are to be construed in accordance with the CREST
Manual.Words and expressions not specifically defined in Articles 31, 32 and 33
shall bear the same meaning as those words and expressions defined in the CREST
Manual.

Subject to such of the restrictions of these Articles as may be applicable any
Member may transfer all or any of his uncertified shares by means of a Relevant
System authorised by the Board in such manner provided for, and subject as
provided, in any regulations issued for this purpose under the Act or such as may
otherwise from time to time be,adopted by. the Board on behalf of the Company and
the rules of any Relevant System and accordingly no provisions of these Articles
shall apply in respect of an Uncertificated share to the extent that it requires or
contemplates the effecting of a transfer by an instrument in writing or the
production of a certificate for the shares to be transferred.

Subject to such of the restrictions contained in these Articles as may be applicable,
any Member may. transfer all or any of his Certificated Shares by instrument in
writing in any usual or common form, or in such other form as the Board shall from
time to time approve. The Board may at any time after the allotment of any share
but before any person has been entered in the Register as the holder thereof
recognise a renunciation thereof by the allottee in favour of some other person and
may accord to any allottee of a share a right to effect such renunciation upon and
subject to such terms and. conditions as the Board.may think fit to impose.

Such instrument of transfer must (if so required by law) be duly stamped and be left
at the Office, or at such other place as the Board may appoint, accompanied by the
certificate for the shares to be transferred and such other evidence (if any) as the
Board may require to prove the title of the intending transferor (and if the
instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority
of that person to do so).

Every instrument of transfer must be in respect of only one class of share.

The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or on behalf of the
transferor, and the transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until
the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect thereof.

In the case of a partly paid up share the instrument of transfer must also be signed
by or on behalf of the transferee.

All instruments of transfer which shall be registered shall be retained by the
Company, but any instrument of transfer which the Board may refuse to register
shall (except in case of fraud) be returned to the party presenting the same.

The Board may only decline to register a transfer of an Uncertificated share in the
circumstances set out in regulations issued for this purpose under the law, and
where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom
the Uncertificated share is to be transferred exceeds four.

The Board may, in its absolute discretion, and without assigning any reason refuse
to register a transfer of any share (not being a fully paid up share) to a person of
whom it does not approve and refuse to register any transfer of any share to more
than four joint holders or any transfer of any share (not being a fully paid up share)
on which the Company has a lien

The Board may require a transferee to supply such information as the Board
reasonably requires to determine whether such transferee qualifies as a Prohibited
Person.

If the transferee is a Prohibited Person the Board may send a notice directing such
transferee to sell his shares within thirty days to a person who is not a Prohibited
Person.

If the holder of, or any other person appearing to be interested in, any share has been
given notice under Article 45 and has failed to transfer that share (the "prohibited
share") in accordance.with the directions of the Company within the period
prescribed in Article 45; the Board shall be empowered at their discretion without
prejudice to any other Article to forfeit and cancel that prohibited share and the
Company will be underno obligation to refund any monies to a Member whose
shares have been cancelled pursuant to this Article and that Member shall be
discharged from any further obligation to the Company:

If the Board shall refuse to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within two
months after the date.on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to
the transferee notice of such refusal.

The registration of transfers of shares or of any class of shares may be suspended at
such times and for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine
provided that such registration,shall not be»suspended for more than thirty days in
any year and provided that any entity which is then acting as a depositary for shares
of the Company will be given at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any such
proposed suspension.

No fee shall be charged:
(A) for registration of a transfer; or
(B) on the registration of any probate, letters of administration, certificate of

death or marriage, power of attorney, notice or other instrument relating to
or affecting the title to any shares.

Nothing in these Articles shall prevent title to any securities of the Company from
being evidenced and transferred without a written instrument in accordance with
statutory regulations from time to time made under the Act and the Board shall have
power to implement any arrangements it may think fit for such evidencing and
transfer which accord with those regulations.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

In the case of the death of a Member, the survivor or survivors, where the deceased
was a joint holder, and the executors or administrators of the deceased, where he
was a sole or only surviving holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the
Company as having any title to his shares, but nothing herein contained shall release
the estate of a deceased holder (whether sole or joint) from any liability in respect of
any share solely or jointly held by him.

Subject to the provisions of these Articles, any person becoming entitled to a share
in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Member may, on such evidence as to
his title being produced as the Board may require, elect either to be registered
himself as holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered
as the transferee thereof.

If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered himself, he shall
deliver or send to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so
elects. If he shall elect to have another person registered, he shall testify his election
by executing a transfer of such share to such person. All the provisions of these
Articles relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares
shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or
bankruptcy of the Member. had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a
transfer executed by such Member.

A person entitled to.a’ share by death or bankruptcy by transmission shall be entitled
to receive, and may give a discharge for, any dividends or other moneys payable in
respect of the share, but he shall not be entitled in respect of it to receive notices of,
or to attend or vote at meetings of the Company, or, save as aforesaid, to exercise
any of the rights or privileges of a Member unless and until he shall become a
Member in respect of the share. The Board may at any time give notice requiring
any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share and if
the notice is not complied with within 60 days the Board may thereafter withhold
payment of all dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the share until the
requirements of the notice have been complied with.

FORFEITURE OF SHARES

(A) If a Member fails to pay the whole or any part of any call or instalment of
a call on or before the day appointed for the payment thereof, the Board
may at any time thereafter, during such time as the call or instalment or
any part thereof remains unpaid, serve a notice on him or on the person
entitled to the share by death or bankruptcy by transmission requiring
payment of such call or instalment or such part thereof as remains unpaid,
together with interest at such rate not exceeding 15 per cent. per annum as
the Board shall determine and any expenses incurred by the Company by
reason of such non-payment.

(B) The notice shall:
(i) name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of seven days
from the date of the notice) on or before which such call or
installment or part thereof and all interest and expenses that have

accrued by reason of such non-payment are to be paid;

(ii) name the place where the payment is to be made; and
56

57

58

59

60

61

62

(iii) state that, in the event of non-payment at or before the time and
at the place appointed, the shares in respect of which such call
was made or installment was due will be liable to be forfeited.

(C) If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with,
any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at any time
thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be
forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that effect. A forfeiture of shares
shall include all dividends in respect of the shares not actually paid before
the forfeiture, notwithstanding that they shall have been declared.

When any share has been forfeited in accordance with these Articles, notice of the
forfeiture shall forthwith be given to the holder of the share or to the person entitled
to the share by reason of death or bankruptcy by transmission, as the case may be,
and an entry of such notice having been given and of the forfeiture with the date
thereof shall forthwith be made in the Register in respect of such share; but the
provisions of this paragraph are directory only, and no forfeiture shall be in any
manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to give such notice or to make such
entry as aforesaid.

Notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid, the Board may, at any time before
the forfeited shares have been otherwise disposed of, annul the forfeiture, on the
terms of payment of allcalls and interest due thereon and all expenses incurred in
respect of the share andon such further terms (if any) as it shall see fit.

The Board may accept a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder.

Every share which shall be forfeited or surrendered shall thereupon become the
property of the Company and within three years of such forfeiture may be sold,
cancelled, re-allotted.or otherwise disposed of either to the person who was before
forfeiture or surrender the holder thereof or entitled thereto or to any other person on
such terms and in such manner as the Board shall think fit, and the Board may if
necessary authorise a person to transfer the same to such other person as aforesaid.

A shareholder whose shares have been forfeited or surrendered shall cease to be a
Member but nevertheless be liable to pay to the Company all calls made and not
paid on such shares at the time of forfeiture or surrender, and interest thereon to the
date of payment in the same manner in all respects as if the shares had not been
forfeited or surrendered, and to satisfy all (if any) the claims and demands which the
Company might have enforced in respect of the shares at the time of forfeiture or
surrender without any reduction or allowance for the value of the shares at the time
of forfeiture.

The forfeiture or surrender of a share shall involve the extinction at the time of
forfeiture or surrender of all interest in and all claims and demands against the
Company in respect of the share as between the shareholder whose share is forfeited
or surrendered and the Company, except only such of those rights and liabilities as
are by these Articles expressly saved, or as are by the Act given or imposed in the
case of past Members.

A declaration in writing that the declarant is a Director or Secretary of the Company
and that a share has been duly forfeited or surrendered in pursuance of these
Articles, and stating the date on which it was forfeited or surrendered, shall, as
against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share adversely to the forfeiture or
surrender thereof, be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated and such
63

declaration, together with the receipt of the Company for the consideration (if any)
given for the share on the sale or disposition thereof and a certificate for the share
under the Seal delivered to the person to whom the same is sold or disposed of, shall
constitute a good title to the share. Subject to the execution of any necessary transfer
such person shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall be discharged
from all calls made prior to such sale or disposition and shall not be bound to see to
the application of the purchase money or other consideration (if any), nor shall his
title to the share be affected by any act, omission or irregularity relating to or
connected with the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture or surrender, sale,
re-allotment or disposal of the share.

The Company in General Meeting may from time to time:
(A) by Ordinary Resolution:

(i) combine all or any of its shares (including issued shares) into a
smaller number of shares. On any combination of fully paid
shares into a smaller number of shares, the Board may settle any
difficulty which may arise as it thinks expedient and in particular
(but. without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) may as
between the ‘holders of shares to be combined determine which
particular shares.are to be combined into each combined share
and in the case of any share registered in the name of one holder
or joint holders being combined with shares registered in the
name of another holder or joint holders may make such
arrangements as may be thought fit for the sale of the combined
share or any fractions thereof and for such purpose may appoint
some person to transfer the combined share to the purchaser and
arrange either for the distribution among the persons entitled
thereto of the net proceeds of such sale after deduction of the
expenses of sale or (when such net proceeds in respect of any
holding do not exceed £2) for the payment of such net proceeds
to the Company. Provided that the necessary unissued shares are
available the Board may alternatively in each case where the
number of shares held by any holder is not an exact multiple of
the number of shares to be combined into a single share issue to
each such holder credited as fully paid up by way of
capitalisation the minimum number of shares required to round
up his holding to such a multiple (such issue being deemed to
have been effected immediately prior to combination) and the
amount required to pay up such shares shall be appropriated at
its discretion from any of the sums standing to the credit of any
of the Company's reserve accounts (including shares premium
account and capital redemption reserve) or to the credit of profit
and loss account and capitalised by applying the same in paying
up such shares;

65

66

(iii) subject to the Act, divide its shares (including issued shares) into
a larger number of shares and so that the resolution whereby any
share is divided may determine that, as between the holders of
the shares resulting from such division, one or more of the shares
may have any such preferred or other special rights over, or may
have such deferred rights or be subject to any such restrictions as
compared with, the others as the Company has power to attach to
unissued or new shares;

(iv) convert the whole, or any particular class, of its preference
shares into redeemable preference shares;

(v) issue shares which shall entitle the holder to no voting right or
entitle the holder to a restricted voting right;

(vi) convert all or any of its fully paid shares the par value (if any) of
which is expressed in a particular currency into fully paid shares
of a par value (if any) which is expressed in a different currency,
the conversion being effected at the rate of exchange (calculated
to not less than three significant figures) current on the date of
the resolution or on such,other date as may be specified therein.

such amount and to be divided into shares of such respective amounts and to carry
such special rights (if any) or to be subject to such restrictions (if any) including
those referred to in Article 2 as the General Meeting resolving on such increase may
direct. Subject to any directions made by the.Company when resolving on the
increase of authorised shares;,any new shares shall, subject to the provisions of
Article 2, be at the disposal of the Board and shall be considered as part of the
original authorised shares and shall be subject to the same provisions with reference
to the payment of calls and the forfeiture of shares on non-payment of calls transfer
and transmission of shares, lien or otherwise as if they had been part of the original
authorised shares.

resolution has on a show of hands been carried, or carried unanimously or by a
particular majority, or lost, or not carried by a particular majority, shall be
conclusive, and an entry to that effect in the minute book of the Company shall be
conclusive evidence thereof, without proof of the number or proportion of the votes
recorded in favour of or against such resolution.

If:

(A) any objection is raised to the qualification of any voter; or

(B) any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or
which might have been rejected; or

(C) any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted

the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution
unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or adjourned meeting at
which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs. Any
objection or error shall be referred to the Chairman of the meeting and shall only
vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the Chairman decides that the

affected the decision, of the meeting. The decision. of the Chairman on such matters
shall be final and conclusive.

the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was
demanded.

shall be taken forthwith.

Chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll
was demanded shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.

transaction of any business, other than the question on which a poll has been
demanded. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn.

classes of shares on a show of hands every Member present in person shall have one
vote, and on a poll every Member shall have one vote for each share of which he is
the holder.

Where in the British Virgin Islands, England or elsewhere a liquidator, receiver or
other person (by whatever name called) has been appointed by any court claiming
jurisdiction in that behalf to exercise powers with respect to the property or affairs
of any Member on the grounds (however formulated) of mental disorder, the Board
83

84

85

appointment as the Board may require, permit such receiver or other person to vote
in person or by proxy on behalf of such Member at any General Meeting.

the vote of the senior who tenders the vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other registered holders of the share,
and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names
stand in the Register.

General Meeting either personally or by proxy or to exercise any privilege as a
Member unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in respect of shares in
the Company have been paid.

entitled to vote except on a poll); and

(B) a Member entitled to more thanone vote need not use all his votes or cast
all the votes he-uses in the same way.

Any person (whether a Member of the Company or not) may be appointed to act as
a proxy. A Member may. appoint two or more persons_as proxies in the alternative

DIRECTORS' CONTRACTING WITH THE COMPANY

Subject to the provisions of the Act, no Director or intending Director shall be
disqualified by his office from contracting with the Company either as vendor,
purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract or arrangement
entered into on behalf of the Company in which any Director is in any way directly
or indirectly interested be liable to be avoided, nor shall any Director so contracting
or being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit realised by
any such contract or arrangement by reason of such Director holding that office, or
of the fiduciary relationship thereby established, provided that the nature of this
interest has been declared by him at the meeting of the Board at which the question
of entering into the contract or arrangement is first taken into consideration, or if the
Director was not at the date of that meeting interested in the proposed contract or
arrangement, then at the next meeting of the Board held after he became so
interested, and in a case where the Director becomes interested in a contract or
arrangement after it is made, then at the first meeting of the Board held after he
becomes so interested. A general notice in writing given to the Board by any
Director to the effect that he is a member of any specified company or firm, and is
to be regarded as interested in any contract which may thereafter be made with such
company or firm, shall (if such Director shall give the same at a meeting of the
Board or shall take reasonable*steps to secure.that the same is brought up and read at
the next meeting of the Board after it is given) be deemed a sufficient declaration of
interest in relation to any.contract so made, An interest of which a Director has no
knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall
not be treated as an interest of his.

A Director must avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a material interest
which conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company. Where
such a material interest exists (but subject to the remainder of this Article 98) the
Director in question shall be prohibited from counting in the quorum or voting in
respect any resolution relating to the matter in which he has a material interest, but
may nevertheless remain present at the meeting and participate in discussion of the
resolution in question. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if:

(A) the situation cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a
conflict of interest; or

(B) the matter has been authorised by a resolution of the Directors (excluding
the Director having the material interest),

the Director in question shall be entitled to count to the quorum and to vote in
respect of any such resolution.

A Director shall (in the absence of some other material interest than is indicated
below) be entitled to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of any
resolution concerning any of the following matters, namely:

(A) the giving of any security or indemnity to him in respect of money lent or
obligations incurred by him at the request of or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries;

(B) the giving of any security or indemnity to a third party in respect of a debt
or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which he
himself has assumed responsibility in whole or in part under a guarantee
or indemnity or by the giving of security;
100

101

102

103

(C) any proposal concerning an offer of shares or debentures or other
securities of or by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for subscription
or purchase in which offer he is or is to be interested as a participant in the
underwriting or sub-underwriting thereof;

(D) any proposal concerning any other company in which he is interested
directly or indirectly and whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise
howsoever, provided that he is not the holder of five per cent or more of
any class of the equity share capital or voting rights of such company (any
such interest being deemed for the purposes of this Article to be a material
interest);

(E) any proposal concerning the adoption modification or operation of a
superannuation fund or retirement, death or disability benefits scheme
under which he may benefit and which has been approved by or is subject
to and conditional on approval by the Board of Inland Revenue for
taxation purposes;

(F) any proposal relating to any arrangement for the benefit of employees
under which he benefits or may benefit in a similar manner as the
employees and which does not accord to him as a Director any privilege or
advantage not generally accorded, to. the employees to whom the
arrangement relates; or

(G) any proposal concerning the purchase and/or maintenance of any
insurance policy under which a Director may benefit.

Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment (including
fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of two or more Directors to offices or
employments with the Company or any company in which the Company is
interested, such proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each
Director separately. In such case each of the Directors concerned (if not debarred
from voting under the proviso to of Article Error! Reference source not found.)
shall be entitled to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution
except that concerning his own appointment:

If any question shall arise at any meeting as to the materiality of a Director's interest
or as to the entitlement of any Director to vote and such question is not resolved by
his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting, such question shall be referred to the
Chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation to any other Director shall be
final and conclusive, except in a case where the nature or extent of the interest of the
Director concerned has not been fairly disclosed.

Any Director may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the
Company and he or his firm shall be entitled to a remuneration for professional
services as if he were not a Director Provided that nothing herein contained shall
authorise a Director or his firm to act as the Auditors.

Any Director may continue to be or become a director of, or hold any other office or
place of profit under, any other company in which the Company may be interested,
and no such Director shall be accountable for any remuneration, salary, commission,
participation in profits, pension, superannuation or other benefits received by him as
a director of, or holder of any other office or place of profit under, or member of,
any such other company. The Board may exercise the voting power conferred by the
shares in any company held or owned by the Company in such manner in all
104

105

106

107

108

providing for the payment of remuneration to the directors of such company).

RECORD DATES

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles the Board may fix a date as
the record date for any dividend, distribution, allotment or issue and such record
date may be on or at any time within six months before or after any date on which
such dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or made.

DIVIDENDS AND RESERVES

The Company in General Meeting may declare dividends but no dividends shall
exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may, before
recommending any dividend, set aside out of profits of the Company such sums as it
thinks fit as a reserve to, inter alia, meet any claim on, or liabilities of, the Company
or for paying off any loan capital or for any. other purpose.

The Board may from time to time pay to the Members such interim dividends as
appear to the Board to be justified by. the profits of the Company and in particular
(but without prejudice,to the generality of the foregoing) if at any time the share
capital of the Company is divided into different classes the Board may pay such
interim dividends in respect of those shares in the capital of the Company which
confer on the holders thereof deferred or non-preferential rights as well as in respect
of those shares which confer on the holders thereof preferential rights with regard to
dividend but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or
non-preferential rights if at the time of payment any preferential dividend is in
arrear. Provided that the Board acts bona fide the Board shall not incur any
responsibility to the holders of shares conferring any preference for any damage that
they may suffer by reason of the payment of_an interim dividend on any shares
having deferred or non-preferential rights.

The Board may also pay half-yearly or at other suitable intervals to be settled by it
any dividend which may be payable at a fixed rate if the Board is of the opinion that
the profits justify the payment.

No dividend shall be paid otherwise than out of profits available for distribution in
accordance with the Act.

No dividend shall bear interest against the Company.

Any dividend unclaimed for a period of twelve years after having been declared (or,
in the case of an interim dividend, remaining uncashed for a period of twelve years
after having been sent) shall be forfeited and shall revert to the Company.

The Board may, before recommending any dividend (whether preferential or
otherwise), set aside out of the profits of the Company such sums as it thinks fit as a
reserve or reserves which shall (subject to the Act) at the discretion of the Board, be
applicable for meeting claims on or liabilities of the Company or contingencies or
for paying off any loan capital or for equalising dividends or for any other purpose
to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied, and pending such
152

153

154

155

156

157

application may, at the like discretion, either be employed in the business of the
Company or be invested in such investments (other than shares of the Company) as
the Board may from time to time think fit, and so that it shall not be necessary to
keep any investments constituting the reserve or reserves separate or distinct from
any other investments of the Company. The Board may also without placing the
same to reserve carry forward any profits which it may think prudent not to divide.

Subject to the rights of persons, if any, entitled to shares with special rights as to
dividend, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up
on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a
share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this Article as paid up
on the share.

All dividends shall be apportioned and (subject to any lien of the Company) paid to
Members on the register on the date the dividend is declared, made or paid
notwithstanding any subsequent transfer or transmission of shares proportionately to
the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in
respect of which the dividend is paid; but if any share is issued on terms providing
that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date such share shall rank for
dividend accordingly.

The Board may deduct from any dividend payable to any Member all sums of
money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or
otherwise in relation to the shares of the Company:

Subject to the provisions of the Act, any General Meeting declaring a dividend may
upon the recommendation of the Board direct payment of such dividend wholly or
partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares or
debentures of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and the Board
shall give effect to such resolution, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such
distribution, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient, and in particular
may issue fractional certificates and fix the value for distribution of such specific
assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to
any Members on the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all
parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to
the Board.

Any dividend, interest or other moneys payable in cash in respect of shares may be
paid by cheque, direct debt, bank transfer, money order, or warrant sent through the
post directed to the registered address of the holder or person entitled thereto or, in
the case of joint holders, to the registered address of that one of the joint holders
who is first named on the Register or to such person and to such address as the
holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such cheque, direct debt, bank
transfer, money order, or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to
whom it is sent. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts
for any dividends or other moneys payable in respect of the shares held by them as
joint holders.

In respect of shares in Uncertificated form, where the Company is authorised to do
so by or on behalf of the holder or joint holders in such manner as the Board shall
from time to time consider sufficient, the Company may pay any such dividends,
interest or other monies by means of the Relevant System. Every such payment
shall be made in such manner as may be consistent with the System’s Rules and,
without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, may include the sending by the
Company or by any person on its behalf of an instruction to the Operator to credit
158

159

160

161

162

the cash memorandum account of the holder or joint holders or, if permitted by the
Company, of such person as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct.

The Company shall not be responsible for any loss of any cheque, warrant or order
and any payment made in any manner permitted by these Articles shall be at the
sole risk of the holder or joint holders. Without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, if any such cheque, warrant or order has been, or is alleged to have been,
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Board may, on request of the person entitled thereto,
issue a replacement cheque, warrant or order subject to compliance with such
conditions as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of out of pocket expenses
of the Company in connection with the request as the Board may think fit.

The issue of such cheque, warrant or order, the collection of funds from or transfer
of funds by a bank in accordance with such direct debit or bank transfer or, in
respect of shares in Uncertificated form, the making of payment in accordance with
the System’s Rules, shall be a good discharge to the Company.

All dividends or other sums payable on or in respect of any shares which remain
unclaimed may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit of
the Company until claimed. Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for six
years from the date when it became due for,payment shall, if the Board so resolves,
be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment by the Board
of any unclaimed dividend or.other sums payable on or in respect of a share into a
separate account shall not.constitute the Company a trustee in respect of it.

A general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the
Board, direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets,
and in particular-of paid up shares or debentures of any other company, and where
any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the Board may settle the same as it
thinks expedient and.in particular may issue fractional certificates or authorise any
person to sell and transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions altogether, and may
fix the value for distribution of any assets and may determine that cash shall be paid
to any Member upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of
Members and may vest any assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Board.

CAPITALISATION OF RESERVES

(A) The Company may, upon recommendation of the Board, resolve to
capitalise any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit
of any of the Company's reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and
loss account and not required for payment of dividend on any shares with
a preferential right to dividend and accordingly that such sum be set free
for distribution amongst the Members on the record date specified in the
relevant resolution who would have been entitled thereto if distributed by
way of dividend and in the same proportion, on condition that the same be
not paid in cash but be applied either in or towards paying up any amounts
for the time being unpaid on any shares held by such Members
respectively or paying up in full unissued shares or debentures of the
Company to be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid up to and
amongst such Members on the record date specified in the relevant
resolution in the proportion aforesaid, or partly in the one way and partly
in the other, and the Board may give effect to such resolution: Provided
that a share premium account and a capital redemption reserve may, for
the purposes of this Article, only be applied in the paying up of unissued
shares to be issued to Members of the Company as fully paid up shares,
(B)

and that no unrealised profits shall be used in paying up any amounts
unpaid on any issued shares.

Subject to approval by the Company in General Meeting and subject as
hereinafter provided, the Board may at their discretion resolve (at the same
time as they resolve to recommend or to pay any dividend in respect of
shares in the capital of the Company) that the holders of such fully paid
shares will have the option to elect to receive in lieu of such dividend (or
part thereof) an allotment of additional shares in the capital of the
Company credited as fully paid provided that:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

an adequate number of unissued shares is available for the
purpose;

the approval by the Company in General Meeting may only be
given in respect of a specified dividend or of any dividends
declared or to be declared or paid in respect of a specified
financial year;

the number of shares to be allotted in lieu of any amount of
dividend as,aforesaid shall be determined by the Board so that
the value of such shares shall equal (as nearly as may be without
exceeding).such amount and for this purpose the value of a share
shall, if the shares.are admitted to trading on AIM, be deemed to
be the average of the middle market quotations of such shares on
AIM (adjusted as below).on the ex-dividend date and on the next
four business days and each such middle market quotation shall
be adjusted by. deducting therefrom the cash amount of such
dividend per share except in the case of any "ex-dividend"
quotation;

the Board after determining the number of shares to be allotted
as aforesaid shall give notice in writing to the Members of the
option to elect accorded to them and shall send with such notice
forms of election which:specify the procedure to be followed and
the place at which duly completed forms of election must be
lodged in order to be effective;

following the receipt of a notice or notices of election pursuant
to paragraph (iv) of this Article the Board shall allot to the
holders of those shares in respect of which the share election has
been or is duly exercised in lieu of the dividend (or that part of
the dividend in respect of which the right of election has been
accorded) such number of additional shares determined as
aforesaid and for such purpose the Board shall appropriate and
capitalise out of any reserve or fund which is available for
distribution (including any share premium account or capital
redemption reserve or profit and loss account) as they shall
determine an amount equal to the aggregate nominal amount of
the additional shares so to be allotted and apply the same in
paying up in full the appropriate number of unissued shares for
allotment and distribution to and amongst those Members who
have given notices of election as aforesaid, such additional
shares to rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid shares
163

164

165

166

167

then in issue save only as regards participation in the relevant
dividend.

Whenever such a capitalisation as aforesaid shall have been resolved upon the
Board shall make all appropriations and applications of the reserves or undivided
profits resolved to be capitalised thereby and all allotments and issues of fully paid
up shares or debentures, if any, and generally shall do all acts and things required to
give effect thereto, with full power to make such provision by the issue of fractional
certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise as it thinks fit including the right of
the Company to retain amounts the cost of apportionment of which would be
disproportionate to the amounts involved in the case of shares or debentures
becoming distributable in fractions and also to authorise any person to enter on
behalf of all the Members entitled thereto into an agreement with the Company
providing for the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid up, of any
shares or debentures to which they may be entitled on such capitalisation and (as the
case may require) for the payment up by the Company on their behalf by the
application thereto of their respective proportions of the reserves or profits resolved
to be capitalised, of the amounts or any part of the amounts remaining unpaid on
their existing shares. Any agreement made under such authority shall be effective
and binding on all such Members.

case may be, that such minutes or extract is a true and accurate record of the
proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

UNTRACED SHAREHOLDERS

When the registered address of any Member appears to the Board to be incorrect or
out of date such Member may, if the Board so resolves, be treated as if he had no
registered address and the Company will not thereafter be obliged to send to such
Member cheques, warrants, notices of meetings or copies of the documents referred
to in these Articles; provided that no resolution as aforesaid shall be proposed by
the Board until cheques or warrants sent to the registered address of such Member

TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

When:

(A) any person acquires whether by a series of transactions over a period of
time or not, an interest in shares which (taken together with shares in
which persons acting in concert with him are interested) carry 30% or
more of the voting rights of the Company; or

(B) any person who, together with»persons acting in concert with him, is

interested in shares which in the aggregate carry not less than 30% of the
voting rights of the Company but. does not hold shares carrying more than
50% of such voting rights and such person, or any person acting in concert
with him, acquires an interest in any other. shares which increases the
percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which he is interested,

such person (the-"offeror") shall, unless the Board determines otherwise, extend an
offer on the basis set out in Articles 188 - 201 (a "mandatory offer"), to the holders
of all the issued shares in the Company.

Any mandatory offer must be conditional only.upon the offeror having received
acceptances in respect of shares which, together with shares acquired or agreed to be
acquired before or during the mandatory offer, will result in the offeror and any
person acting in concert with it holding shares carrying more than 50% of voting
rights in the Company.

No acquisition of any interest in shares which would give rise to a requirement for
an mandatory offer may be made or registered if the making or implementation of
such offer would or might be dependent on the passing or a resolution at any
meeting of shareholders of the offeror or upon any other conditions, consents or
arrangements.

Any mandatory offer must, in respect of each class of share capital involved, be in
cash or be accompanied by a cash alternative at not less than the highest price paid
by the offeror or any person acting in concert with it for any interest in shares of that
class during the offer period and within 12 months prior to the announcement of that
offer. The cash offer or the cash alternative must remain open after the offer has
become or is declared unconditional as to acceptances for not less than 14 days after
the date on which it would otherwise have expired. No less than 3 days prior to the
issue of an offer document in connection with a mandatory offer, the offeror must
produce to the Board a written confirmation from an appropriate third party that
resources are available to the offeror sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the
mandatory offer.

195

196

Where Directors (and their close relatives and related trusts) sell shares to a person
(or enter into options, derivatives or other transactions) as a result of which that
person is required to make a mandatory offer, the Directors must ensure that as a
condition to the sale (or other relevant transaction) the person undertakes to fulfil
his obligations to make a mandatory offer. In addition, and except with the consent
of the Board:

(A) such Directors should not resign from the Board until the first closing date
of the mandatory offer or the date when the offer becomes or is declared
wholly unconditional, whichever is later; and

(B) no nominee of any offeror or persons acting in concert with it may be
appointed as a Director, nor may any offeror or persons acting in concert
with it exercise the votes attaching to any shares held in the Company until
the offer document has been posted.

Save to the extent that the Board determines otherwise:

(A) any mandatory offer shall be made on terms that would be required by the
then current City Code, including without limitation any provisions of the
City Code which would be applicable to an offer required to be made
pursuant to rules of the City Code relating to the "Mandatory Offer and its
terms";

(B) words and expressions used in or defined in the City Code shall bear the
same meanings given by the City Code in Articles 188 - 201;

to be determined by the Panel shall be determined by the Board in its absolute
discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to make such determination.

person (other than the Company) shall be given to the Company at its registered
office.

Any Member who is under.an_ obligation to make a mandatory offer shall be
required to make such offer in compliance with the requirements of the City Code
unless otherwise notified in writing by the Board.

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Member having incurred an obligation
to make a mandatory offer to the holders of all the issued shares in the Company
shall have failed so to do, or that any Member is in default of any other obligation
imposed upon Members pursuant to Articles 188 - 201, then the Board may, in its
absolute discretion at any time thereafter by notice (a "direction notice") to such
Member and any other member acting in concert with such Member (together the
"defaulters") direct that:

(A) in respect of the shares held by the defaulters (the "default shares"), the
defaulters shall not be entitled to vote at a General Meeting either
personally or by proxy or to exercise any other right conferred by
membership in relation to meetings of the Company;

(B) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any
sums due from the Company on the default shares, whether in respect of
capital or dividend or otherwise, and the Company shall not meet any
197

198

liability to pay interest on any such payment when it is finally paid to the
Member; and

(C) no other distribution shall be made on the default shares.
The Board may at any time give notice cancelling a direction notice.
If a mandatory offer shall be made and:

(A) the offeror (together with persons acting in concert with him) has by virtue
of acceptance of the offer acquired or contracted to acquire some (but not
all) of the shares to which the offer relates; and

(B) those shares, with or without any other shares which the offeror (together
with persons acting in concert with him) holds or has acquired or
contracted to acquire,

would result in the offeror (together with persons acting in concert with him)
obtaining or holding an interest in shares conferring in aggregate 90 per cent, or
more of the voting rights conferred by all the shares then in issue then the offeror
shall be entitled to give a notice ("Squeeze Out Notice") to all other holders of
shares in respect of all the shares then in issue and held by them in respect of which
the offer has not yet been-accepted. The Squeeze Out Notice shall be made in
writing, be at the same-price and on.the same terms as the offer and be capable of
acceptance for a period of not less-than 30.days after the date of the Squeeze Out
Notice.

Shareholders"):

(A) shall be deemed to have accepted the offer in respect of all shares held by
it; and
(B) shall become obliged to deliver to the offeror an executed transfer of such

Shares and (if it exists) the certificate(s) in respect of the same.

Squeeze Out Notices shall be irrevocable but will lapse if for any reason there is not
a sale of the Called Shareholders’ shares within 60 days after the date of service of
the Squeeze Out Notice. The offeror shall be entitled to serve further Squeeze Out
Notices following the lapse of any particular Squeeze Out Notice.

Completion of the sale of shares pursuant to a Squeeze Out Offer shall take place on
the same date on which shares are sold under the offer (or, if later, within 7 days of
expiry of the period for acceptances of the Squeeze Out Offer).

Upon any person, following the issue of a Squeeze Out Notice, becoming a Member
of the Company pursuant to the exercise of a pre-existing option to acquire sares in
the Company (a "New Member"), a Squeeze Out Notice shall be deemed to have
been served upon the New Member on the same terms as the previous Squeeze Out
Notice who shall thereupon be bound to sell and transfer all such Shares acquired by
him to the offeror or as the offeror may direct and the provisions of this Articles 197
— 201 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the New Member save that completion of the
sale of such shares shall take place forthwith upon the Squeeze Out Notice being
deemed served on the New Member.

payment of the consideration for the shares (whether to the relevant Members or to
the Company) and the Company receiving a transfer (duly stamped if appropriate),

person on behalf of any holder of shares pursuant to Article 200 the offeror or its
nominee shall be entered in the Register. The certificate(s) in respect of any shares
so transferred, in the name of the original Member shall be deemed to be cancelled
and (if required by the purchaser) a new certificate shall be issued in the same name
of offeror or its nominee. The receipt of the Company for the consideration shall be
a good discharge to purchaser who shall not be bound to see the application of it,
and after such registration in exercise of the above powers the validity of the
proceedings shall not be questioned by any person. The Company shall hold the
said consideration on behalf of any such Member in a separate bank account on trust
for the relevant Member pending delivery up of the cancelled certificate(s) (if any
exist).

If any holder of shares does not on completion of the sale of any Shares pursuant to
a mandatory offer execute transfer(s) in respect of all the shares held by him the
defaulting holder shall be deemed to have irrevocably appointed any person
nominated for the purpose by the Company to be his agent and attorney to execute
all necessary transfer(s) on his behalf and against receipt by the Company (on trust
for such holder) or the. purchase.monies or any other consideration payable for the
relevant shares deliver such transfer(s) to the offeror (or as he may direct) and the
directors shall forthwith register the-offeror (or his nominee) as the holder thereof
and, after the offeror (or his nominee) has been registered as the holder, the validity
of such proceedings shall not be questioned by any such person. It shall be no

mandatory offer in any particular circumstances.

prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information thereby required, or

such form as the Board may in its absolute discretion require to
the effect that after due and careful enquiry the Member is
satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such
information is interested in any of the shares the subject of the
transfer; or

(b) the transfer is an "approved transfer" as defined in Article 206.

The Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested in the
shares the subject of any direction notice a copy of the notice, but the failure or
omission by the Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice.

205

206

207.

Any direction notice shall cease to have effect:

(A) In relation to any shares which are transferred by such Member by means
of an "approved transfer" as defined in Article 206; or

appearing to be interested in shares held by such Member, has given to the
Company the information required by the relevant section 793 notice.

interested or (ii) fails to establish the identities of all those interested in the
shares and (after taking into account the said notification and any other
relevant section 793 notification) the Company knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the person in question is or may be interested in the
shares;

(B) the prescribed-period is 14 calendar days from the date of service of the
said notice under the section 793 notice unless the default shares represent
at least %4 per cent, of the issued shares of that class, when the prescribed
period is.7 calendar days from that date.

of a take-over offer made in respect of all of the issued shares of the
Company;
