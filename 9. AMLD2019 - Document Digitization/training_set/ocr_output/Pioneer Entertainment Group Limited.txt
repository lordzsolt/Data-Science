MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Any director of the Company may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such
manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the director considers necessary or
desirable.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 30% or more of the voting rights in respect
of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting of Shareholders.

The director convening a meeting shall give notless than 7 days’ notice of a meeting of Shareholders to:

(a) those Shareholders whose. names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the
register of members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and

Shareholders that are entitledto vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other
date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90% of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the
meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the
meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.

Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not received
notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on
behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting before the
time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The
notice of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or time at which the proxy shall be
presented.

approved by the directors or as the chairman of the meeting shall accept as properly evidencing the
wishes of the Shareholder appointing the proxy.

in person or by proxy not less than 50% of the votes of the Shares entitled to vote on Resolutions of
Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single Shareholder or proxy

adjourned meeting there are present within one hour from the time appointed for the meeting in person
or by proxy not less than one third of the votes of the Shares or each class or series of Shares entitled to
vote on the matters to be considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but
otherwise the meeting shall be dissolved.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the chairman of the board of directors shall preside as chairman of
the meeting. If there is no chairman of the board of directors or if that chairman is not present at the
meeting, the Shareholders present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman. If the
Shareholders are unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest
number of voting Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as chairman failing
which the oldest individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from
place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left
unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

chairman shall cause a poll to be taken. Ifa poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced
to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives of
persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a Shareholder shall be
determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which, the person is
constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the directors may in good faith seek legal advice
from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the
directors may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the
Company.

Any person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other
governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of
Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be entitled to
exercise the same rights on behalf of the Shareholder which he represents as that Shareholder could
exercise if it were an individual.

The chairman of any meeting at which.a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any person other than an
individual may call for a notarial, certified copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced
within 7 days of being so requested-or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such person shall be
disregarded.

meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such resolution
shall forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in
the form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the consent is
in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take
effect on the earliest date upon which Shareholders holding a sufficient number of votes of Shares to
constitute a Resolution of Shareholders have consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of
a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the
meeting.

A director of the company (the “appointing director”) may appoint any other director or any other
eligible person as his alternate to exercise the appointing director’s powers and carry out the appointing
director’s responsibilities in relation to the taking of decisions by the directors in the absence of the

a further alternate, whether of the appointing director or of the alternate director, and the alternate does
not act as an agent of or for the appointing director.

The appointing director may, at any time, voluntarily terminate the alternate director’s appointment.
The voluntary termination of the appointment of an alternate shall take effect from the time when
written notice of the termination is given to the Company. The rights of an alternate shall
automatically terminate if the appointing director.dies or otherwise ceases to hold office.

are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of directors, subject to a
minimum of 2.

apply and such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not

there is no chairman of the board of directors or if the chairman of the board is not present, the directors
present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken
by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors consented to in writing by all
directors or by all members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The
consent may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If

counterparts.

reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was. unlawful.

the Company if he acts in the best interests of the Company’s parent in the circumstances specified in
Sub-Regulation 9.3.

The decision of the directors as'to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view
to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe
that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles,
unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a
nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good
faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by avdirector in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if it shall

accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1.

investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such

Company in accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the
Company deems appropriate.
