any power under the disclosure provisions requiring Members to disclose an interest in the Company’s shares pursuant to Article 6, the
reduction of capital on such shares, the conversion of shares in accordance with these Articles, or by the purchase or redemption by the
Company of its own shares or the sale of any shares held as Treasury Shares in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

No shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of Directors has been passed stating:

(a) the amount to be credited for the issue of the shares;
(b) their determination of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money consideration for the issue; and
(c) that, in their opinion, the present cash value of the non-money consideration for the issue is not less than the amount to be

credited for the issue of the shares.

The Company shall keep a register (the register of Members ) containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the persons who hold shares;

(b) the number of each class and series of shares held by each Member;

(c) the date on which the name of each Member was entered in the register of Members; and
(d) the date on which any person ceased to be a Member.

The register of Members may be in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic, electronic or other data storage
form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its contents. Until the Directors otherwise determine, the magnetic,
electronic or other data storage form shall be the original register of Members.

A share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Member is entered in the register of Members.

Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon any trust and (except as otherwise
provided by these Articles or by law) the Company shall not be bound by or recognise (even when having notice thereof) any interest in
any share other than an absolute right of the registered holder to the entirety of a share or fraction thereof.

On a winding up of the Company the assets (if any) of the Company available for distribution to Members shall be distributed to the
holders of Ordinary Shares and Founder Preferred Shares pro rata to the number of such paid up shares held by each holder relative to
the total number of issued and paid up Ordinary Shares as if such paid up Founder Preferred Shares had been converted into Ordinary
Shares immediately prior to the winding-up.

The Company may, subject to the provisions of the Act and of these Articles, issue warrants or grant options to subscribe for shares in
the Company. Such warrants or options shall be issued upon such terms and subject to such conditions as may be resolved upon by the
Board.

PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS
Section 46 of the Act does not apply to the Company.

Subject to the other provisions of this Article 3, with effect following Admission the Company shall not issue any equity securities (and
shall not sell any of them from treasury) to a person on any terms unless:

(a) it has made an offer to each person who is a holder of equity securities of that class (other than the Company itself by virtue
of it holding Treasury Shares) to issue to him on the same or more favourable terms a proportion of those equity securities
which is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in value held by the holders of the relevant class(es) of equity
securities then in issue; and

(b) the period during which any such offer may be accepted by the relevant current holders has expired or the Company has
received a notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made from such holders.

Equity securities that the Company has offered to issue to a holder of equity securities in accordance with Article 3.2 may be issued to
him, or anyone in whose favour he has renounced his right to their issue, without contravening Article 3.2 above.

An offer under Article 3.2 shall be made to holders in writing in accordance with the notice provisions of these Articles.

Where equity securities are held by two or more persons jointly, an offer under Article 3.2 may be made to the joint holder first named
in the register of Members in respect of those equity securities.

In the case of a holder’s death or bankruptcy, the offer must be made:

(a) by sending it by post in a prepaid letter addressed to the persons claiming to be entitled to the equity securities in consequence
of the death or bankruptcy by name, or by the title of the representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the bankruptcy, or by
any like description, at the address supplied for the purpose by those claiming; or

(b) until any such address has been so supplied giving the notice in any manner in which it would have been given if the death or
bankruptcy has not occurred.

If the relevant holder in relation to an offer under Article 3.2 has no registered address in the United Kingdom or the British Virgin
Islands for the service of notices on him the offer may be made by causing it or a notice of where a copy may be obtained or inspected
to be published in (1) at least one United Kingdom national daily newspaper and (ii) either one newspaper circulated widely in the
British Virgin Islands or the BVI Gazette.

An offer pursuant to Article 3.2 must state a period of not less than 14 (fourteen) calendar days during which it may be accepted and the
offer shall not be withdrawn before the end of that period.

The provisions of Article 3.2 shall not apply in relation to the issue of:

(a) bonus shares;
(b) equity securities if they are, or are to be, wholly or partly paid up otherwise than in cash; and
(c) equity securities which would apart from any renunciation or assignment of the right to their issue, be held under an employee

share scheme.
Equity securities held by the Company as Treasury Shares are disregarded for the purpose of this Article 3 so that:
(a) the Company is not treated as a person who holds equity securities; and
(b) equity securities held as Treasury Shares are not treated as shares in issue of the Company.

Subject to the Act, the Directors may be given by virtue of a Special Resolution of Members the power to issue or sell from treasury
equity securities of any class either generally or in respect of a specific issue or sale and, on the passing of the resolution, the Directors
shall have power to issue or sell from treasury pursuant to that authority, equity securities wholly for cash as if the provisions of Article
3.2 above do not apply to the issue or sale from treasury and the authority granted by the Special Resolution of Members may be
granted for such period of time as such resolution permits and such authority may be revoked by a further Special Resolution of
Members. Notwithstanding that any such resolution may have expired, the Directors may issue or sell from treasury equity securities in
pursuance of an offer or agreement previously made by the Company, if the resolution enabled the Company to make an offer or
agreement which would or might require equity securities to be issued or sold from treasury after it expired.

DIVIDEND RIGHTS OF FOUNDER PREFERRED SHARES

From such time after the Acquisition as the Average Price per Ordinary Share is US$11.50 (subject to such adjustment either as the
Directors in their absolute discretion determine to be fair and reasonable in the event of a consolidation or sub-division of the Ordinary
Shares in issue after the date of Admission or otherwise as determined in accordance with Article 5.5) or more for ten consecutive
Trading Days, the holders of Founder Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive the Annual Dividend Amount in respect of each
Dividend Year as calculated in accordance with these Articles. Each Annual Dividend Amount shall be divided between the holders pro
rata to the number of Founder Preferred Shares held by them on the relevant Dividend Date. The Annual Dividend Amount will be paid
on the Payment Date by the issue to each holder of Founder Preferred Shares of such number of whole Ordinary Shares as is equal to
the pro rata amount of the Annual Dividend Amount to which they are entitled divided by the Average Price per

A-14

5.3

Ordinary Share on the relevant Dividend Date (provided that any fractional Ordinary Shares due to a holder resulting from such
calculation shall not be issued and such holder shall be entitled to be paid the nearest lower whole number of Ordinary Shares).

In the event of the Company entering liquidation, the Dividend Date for the relevant Dividend Year shall be the Trading Day
immediately prior to the date of commencement of liquidation and accordingly an Annual Dividend Amount shall be calculated as of
such Dividend Date and be payable on the relevant Payment Date.

In the event of an automatic conversion of Founder Preferred Shares occurring in accordance with Article 5.1, the Dividend Date for the
relevant Dividend Year shall be the Trading Day immediately prior to the relevant Conversion Date and accordingly an Annual
Dividend Amount shall be calculated as of such Dividend Date and be payable on the relevant Payment Date.

For the avoidance of doubt, any Annual Dividend Amount due in respect of a Dividend Year, including in accordance with Article 4.2
or 4.3, shall be payable in full and shall not be subject to prorating notwithstanding any Dividend Year being longer or shorter than 12
months.

CONVERSION OF FOUNDER PREFERRED SHARES

Each Founder Preferred Share will be automatically converted into one Ordinary Share (subject to such adjustment either as the
Directors in their absolute discretion determine to be fair and reasonable in the event of a consolidation or sub-division of the Ordinary
Shares in issue after the date of Admission or otherwise as determined in accordance with Article 5.5) upon the earliest of the following
to occur:

(a) immediately upon a Change of Control; or

(b) immediately upon the last day of the seventh full Financial Year of the Company after completion of the Acquisition (or such
subsequent date as determined in accordance with Article 5.2),

or, if either such date is not a Trading Day, on the first Trading Day immediately following such date (the Conversion Date ) .

Upon notice in writing from the holders of a majority of the Founder Preferred Shares to the Company to be received not less than ten
Business Days prior to the last day of the seventh full Financial Year of the Company after completion of the Acquisition, such holder
(s) may request that the date of automatic conversion as specified in Article 5.1(b) above be deferred to the last day of the eighth full
Financial Year of the Company following completion of the Acquisition. If a majority of the Independent Directors determine in their
discretion to defer the relevant Conversion Date as requested then (i) the date of automatic conversion as specified in Article 5.1(b) shall
be such deferred date; and (ii) the holders of a majority of the Founder Preferred Shares will have the right to make a further request in
writing no later than ten Business Days prior to the last day of the eighth full Financial Year of the Company after completion of the
Acquisition for the deferral of the relevant Conversion Date by a further year. In the event a majority of the Independent Directors
approve any such further request for a deferral of the relevant Conversion Date then (1) the date of automatic conversion as specified in
Article 5.1(b) shall be such deferred date and (ii) the holders of a majority of Founder Preferred Shares will have the right to make one
further request on the same basis as referenced above no later than ten Business Days prior to the last day of the ninth full Financial
Year of the Company after completion of the Acquisition for the deferral of the relevant Conversion Date by a further year. In the event
that a majority of the Independent Directors approve any such further request for a deferral of the relevant Conversion Date then the
date of automatic conversion as specified in Article 5.1(b) shall be such deferred date. In no circumstances shall the Conversion Date
determined pursuant to Article 5.1(b) and this Article 5.2 be deferred beyond the last day of the tenth full Financial Year of the
Company after completion of the Acquisition (or, if either such date is not a Trading Day, on the first Trading Day immediately
following such date).

A holder of Founder Preferred Shares may by notice in writing to the Company require the conversion of such number of that holder’s
Founder Preferred Shares as is specified in such notice (and, if such notice is

A-15
Table of Contents

5.4

5.5

silent as to the number of Founder Preferred Shares, that holder shall be deemed to have required the conversion of all of his Founder
Preferred Shares), into an equal number of Ordinary Shares (subject to such adjustment either as the Directors in their absolute
discretion determine to be fair and reasonable in the event of a consolidation or sub-division of the Ordinary Shares in issue after the
date of Admission or otherwise as determined in accordance with Article 5.5), and in such circumstances those Founder Preferred
Shares the subject of such notice shall be converted five Trading Days following receipt of the notice by the Company. In the event of a
conversion pursuant to this Article 5.3, the holder whose Founder Preferred Shares are converted shall not be entitled to receive, in
respect of the Founder Preferred Shares converted, the relevant pro rata amount of the Annual Dividend Amount which may have been
attributable to those Founder Preferred Shares in respect of the Dividend Year in which the date of conversion occurs.

In the event of a conversion pursuant to Article 5.1 or Article 5.3:

(a) any share certificates relating to the converted shares shall be cancelled and the Company shall issue to the relevant Member
new certificates in respect of the Ordinary Shares which have arisen on the conversion unless the holder elects (or is deemed
to have elected) to hold their new Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form;

(b) subject to the terms of these Articles, the Ordinary Shares arising on conversion shall be credited as paid up and shall rank
pari passu with the outstanding Ordinary Shares of the Company in issue at the Conversion Date, including as to dividends
and other distributions declared, by reference to a record date falling after the Conversion Date; and

(c) where the Ordinary Shares (or any interests therein) are listed or traded on any stock exchange or securities market the
Company shall use reasonable endeavours, including the issue of any prospectus, listing document or similar as may be
required, to procure that, upon conversion, the Ordinary Shares arising from such conversion (or any interests therein) are
promptly admitted to such stock exchange or securities market (or where more than one, all of them) and that any interests in
the Ordinary Shares (including depositary interests) be capable of being transferred in a Relevant System.

Notwithstanding any other provisions in these Articles, in any circumstances where:

(a) the Directors or the holders of a majority of the outstanding Founder Preferred Shares consider that an adjustment should be
made to (1) any factor relevant for the calculation of the Annual Dividend Amount (including the amount which the Average
Price per Ordinary Share must meet or exceed for ten consecutive Trading Days in order for the right to an Annual Dividend
Amount to commence (initially set at US$11.50)) or (2) the number of Ordinary Shares into which the Founder Preferred
Shares shall convert, whether following a consolidation or sub-division of the Ordinary Shares in issue after the date of
Admission or otherwise; or

(b) the holders of a majority of the outstanding Founder Preferred Shares disagree with any adjustment as determined by the
Directors,

the Directors will either (i) make such adjustment as is mutually determined by the Directors and the holders of the majority of the
outstanding Founder Preferred Shares (acting reasonably) or (ii) failing agreement within a reasonable time, will at the Company’s
expense appoint the Auditors, or such other person as the Directors shall, acting reasonably, determine to be an expert for such purpose,
to determine as soon as practicable what adjustment (if any) is fair and reasonable. Upon determination in either case the adjustment (if
any) will be made and will take effect in accordance with the determination. The Auditors (or such other expert as may be appointed)
shall be deemed to act as an expert and not an arbitrator and applicable laws relating to arbitration shall not apply, the determination of
the Auditors (or such other expert as may be appointed) shall be final and binding on all concerned and the Auditors (or such other
expert as may be appointed) shall be given by the Company all such information and other assistance as they may reasonable require.

Conversion of the Founder Preferred Shares pursuant to this Article 5 shall be in such manner as may be determined by the Company,
including, without limitation, by redemption of such shares and applying the proceeds in the subscription for the applicable number of
Ordinary Shares, by means of sub-division and/or consolidation and/or a combination of both (in which case, for the avoidance of
doubt, the requisite sub-division and/or consolidation shall be effected pursuant to the provisions of these Articles), by automatically
converting the Founder Preferred Shares into Ordinary Shares or by redesignating any such Founder Preferred Shares as Ordinary
Shares.

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

The Company may, by notice in writing (a Disclosure Notice ) require a person whom the Company knows to be or has reasonable
cause to believe is or, at any time during the 3 (three) years immediately preceding the date on which the Disclosure Notice is issued, to
have been interested in any shares:

(a) to confirm that fact or (as the case may be) to indicate whether or not it is the case; and
(b) to give such further information as may be required in accordance with Article 6.2.

A Disclosure Notice may (without limitation) require the person to whom it is addressed:

(a) to give particulars of his status (including whether such person constitutes or is acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a Plan
or is a US Person), domicile, nationality and residency;

(b) to give particulars of his own past or present interest in any shares (held by him at any time during the 3 (three) year period
specified in Article 6.1);

(c) to disclose the identity of any other person who has a present interest in the shares held by him;

(d) where the interest is a present interest and any other interest in any shares subsisted during that 3 (three) year period at any

time when his own interest subsisted, to give (so far as is within his knowledge) such particulars with respect to that other
interest as may be required by the Disclosure Notice; and

(e) where his interest is a past interest to give (so far as is within his knowledge) like particulars of the identity of the person who
held that interest immediately upon his ceasing to hold it.

Any Disclosure Notice shall require any information in response to such notice to be given within the prescribed period (which is 14
(fourteen) calendar days after service of the notice or 7 (seven) days if the shares concerned represent 0.25 (nought point two five) per
cent. or more in number of the issued shares of the relevant class) or such other reasonable period as the Directors may determine.

If any Member is in default in supplying to the Company the information required by the Company within the prescribed period or such
other reasonable period as the Directors determine, the Directors in their absolute discretion may serve a direction notice on the
Member. The direction notice may direct that in respect of the shares in respect of which the default has occurred (the Default Shares )
the Member shall not be entitled to attend or vote in meetings of Members or class meetings. Where the Default Shares represent at least
0.25 (nought point two five) per cent. in number of the class of shares concerned the direction notice may additionally direct that
dividends on such shares will be retained by the Company (without interest) and that no transfer of the Default Shares (other than a
transfer authorised under the Articles) shall be registered until the default is rectified; or subject always to the rules of a Relevant
System, the Listing Rules and the requirements of the UKLA and the London Stock Exchange in respect of the Default Shares where
the Directors have any grounds to believe that such Default Shares are held by or for the benefit of or by persons acting on behalf of a
Plan or a US Person, the Directors may in their discretion deem the default shares to be held by, or on behalf of or for the benefit of, a
Plan or a US Person (as the Directors may determine) and that the provisions of Article 13 should apply to such Default Shares.

Where Default Shares in which a person appears to be interested are held by a Depositary, the provisions of this Article 6 shall be
treated as applying only to those shares held by the Depositary in which such person appears to be interested and not (insofar as such
person’s apparent interest is concerned) to any other shares held by the Depositary.

Where the Member on which a Disclosure Notice is served is a Depositary acting in its capacity as such, the obligations of the
Depositary as a Member shall be limited to disclosing to the Company such information relating to any person appearing to be
interested in the shares held by it, as has been recorded by it pursuant to the arrangements entered into by the Company or approved by
the Board pursuant to which it was appointed as a Depositary.

CERTIFICATES

The Company may (but shall not be obliged to) issue to a Member without payment one certificate for all the shares of each class held
by him (and upon transferring a part of his holding of shares of any class to a certificate for the balance of such holding) or several
certificates each for one or more of his certificated shares upon payment, for every certificate after the first, of such reasonable sum as
the Directors may determine. Every certificate shall specify the number, class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which
it relates and the amount or respective amounts paid up or partly paid thereon. The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one
certificate for certificated shares held jointly by several persons and delivery of a certificate to one joint holder shall be a sufficient
delivery to all of them.

All forms of certificate for shares or any other form of security shall be issued in such manner as the Directors may determine which
may include under the Seal, which may be affixed to or printed on it or in such other manner as the Directors may approve, having
regard to the terms of allotment or issue of shares, and shall be signed autographically unless there shall be in force a Resolution of
Directors adopting some method of mechanical signature in which event the signatures (if authorised by such resolution) may be
appended by the method so adopted.

If a share certificate is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and
payment of the liability and expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating evidence as the Directors may determine but
otherwise free of charge and (in the case of defacement or wearing out) on delivery up of the old certificate.

Any Member receiving a certificate shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Directors and officers harmless from any loss or
liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the
possession thereof.

No provision of these Articles shall apply so as to require the Company to issue a certificate to any person holding such shares in
uncertificated form.

Uncertificated shares of a class are not to be regarded as forming a separate class from certificated shares of that class.

LIEN

The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a paid up share) for all monies (whether presently payable
or not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that share. The Directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part
exempt from the provisions of this Article. The Company’s lien on a share shall extend to any amount payable in respect of it.

The Company may sell in such manner as the Directors determine any shares on which the Company has a lien if a sum in respect of
which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within 14 (fourteen) calendar days after notice has been given to the holder of
the share or to the person entitled to it by transmission or operation of the law, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not
complied with the shares may be sold.

To give effect to a sale the Directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares sold to or in accordance
with the directions of the purchaser. The title of the transferee to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of
the proceedings in reference to the sale.

The net proceeds of the sale after payment of the costs shall be applied in payment of so much of the sum for which the lien exists as is
presently payable and any residue shall (upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the shares sold and subject
to a like lien for any moneys not presently payable as existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares
at the date of the sale.

CALLS IN RESPECT OF SHARES AND FORFEITURE

Subject to the terms of allotment the Directors may make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid in respect of their
shares and each Member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 (fourteen) calendar days’ notice specifying when and where payment is to
be made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called in respect of his shares. A call may be required to be paid by
instalments. A call may, before receipt by the Company of any sum due thereunder, be revoked in whole or part and payment of a call
may be postponed in whole or part. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the
subsequent transfer of the shares in respect whereof the call was made.

A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed.
The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect thereof.

If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due and payable shall pay interest on the
amount unpaid from the calendar day it became due and payable until it is paid; either at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the
share or in the notice of the call or at such rate not exceeding 15 (fifteen) per cent. per annum as the Directors may determine. The
Directors may waive payment of the interest wholly or in part.

An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of the issue price or premium or as an
instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid the provisions of these Articles shall apply as if that amount had
become due and payable by virtue of a call. The Company may accept from a Member the whole or a part of the amount remaining
unpaid on any shares held by him although no part of that amount has been called up.

Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may make arrangements on the issue of shares to distinguish between Members as to the
amounts and times of payment of calls in respect of their shares.

If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the Directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less than

(14) fourteen calendar days’ notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any
expenses which may have been incurred by the Company in respect thereof. The notice shall name the place where payment is to be
made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

If the notice is not complied with any share in respect of which it was given may at any time thereafter before the payment required by
the notice has been made be forfeited by a resolution of the Directors and the forfeiture shall include all dividends or other moneys
payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before the forfeiture.

A forfeited share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such a manner as the Directors determine either
to the person who was before the forfeiture the holder or to any other person and at any time before sale re-allotment or other
disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on

10.2

such terms as the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share is to be transferred to any person the
Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to that person.

A person any of whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for
cancellation the certificate for any certificated shares forfeited but shall remain liable to the Company for all monies which at the date of
forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of those shares with interest at the rate at which interest was payable
on those monies before the forfeiture or at such rate as the Directors may determine from the date of forfeiture and all expenses until
payment but the Directors may waive payment wholly or in part or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the shares at
the time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal.

A declaration under oath by a Director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of
the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share and the declaration shall (subject to the execution of an
instrument of transfer if necessary) constitute a good title to the share and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall not be

bound to see to the application of the consideration, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity
of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture or disposal of the share.

UNTRACED SHAREHOLDERS

The Company may sell the share of a Member or of a person entitled by transmission at the best price reasonably obtainable at the time
of sale, if:

(a) during a period of not less than 12 (twelve) years before the date of publication of the advertisements referred to in sub-
paragraph (c) of this Article 10.1 (or, if published on two different dates, the first date) (the relevant period) at least three cash
dividends have become payable in respect of the share;

(b) throughout the relevant period no cheque payable on the share has been presented by the holder of, or the person entitled by
transmission to, the share to the paying bank of the relevant cheque no payment made by the Company by any other means
permitted by Article 15.8 has been claimed or accepted and, so far as any Director of the Company at the end of the relevant
period is then aware, the Company has not at any time during the relevant period received any communication from the
holder of, or person entitled by transmission to, the share;

(c) on expiry of the relevant period the Company has given notice of its intention to sell the share by advertisement in (i) a United
Kingdom national daily newspaper (ii) either one newspaper circulated widely in the British Virgin Islands or the BVI
Gazette and (iii) a newspaper circulating in the area of the address of the holder of, or person entitled by transmission to, the
share shown in the register of Members; and

(d) the Company has not, so far as the Board is aware, during a further period of three months after the date of the advertisements
referred to in sub-paragraph (c) of this Article 10.1 (or the later advertisement if the advertisements are published on different
dates) and before the exercise of the power of sale received a communication from the holder of, or person entitled by
transmission to, the share.

Where a power of sale is exercisable over a share pursuant to Article 10.1 (a Sale Share ), the Company may at the same time also sell
any additional share issued in right of such Sale Share or in right of such an additional share previously so issued provided that the
requirements of sub-paragraphs (b) to (d) of Article 10.1 (as if the words “throughout the relevant period” were omitted from sub-
paragraph (b) and the words “on expiry of the relevant period” were omitted from sub-paragraph (c)) shall have been satisfied in
relation to the additional share.

To give effect to a sale pursuant to Article 10.1 and Article 10.2, the Board may authorise a person to transfer the share in the name and
on behalf of the holder of, or person entitled by transmission to, the share, or to cause the transfer of such share, to the purchaser or his
nominee and in relation to an uncertificated share may require the operator of any Relevant System to convert the share into certificated
form. The purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the purchase money and the title of the transferee is not affected by an
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings connected with the sale of the share.

The Company shall be indebted to the Member or other person entitled by transmission to the share for the net proceeds of sale and
shall carry any amount received on sale to a separate account. The Company is deemed to be a debtor and not a trustee in respect of that
amount for the Member or other person. Any amount carried to the separate account may either be employed in the business of the
Company or invested as the Board may think fit. No interest is payable on that amount and the Company is not required to account for
money earned on it.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Subject to the Act and the terms of these Articles any Member may transfer all or any of his certificated shares by an instrument of
transfer in any usual form or in any other form which the Directors may approve. The Directors may, without assigning any reasons
therefor, refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share (whether paid up or not) unless the instrument of transfer is lodged with the
Company and is accompanied by any certificates for the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may require
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer.

Subject to the Act, the Directors may accept such evidence of title of the transfer of uncertificated shares as they shall in their discretion
determine. The Directors may permit shares (or interests in shares) held in uncertificated form (including in the form of depositary
interests or similar interests, instruments or Securities) to be transferred by means of a Relevant System of holding and transferring
shares (or interests in shares) in uncertificated form in such manner as the Directors may determine from time to time. The Directors
shall, subject always to the Act and any other applicable laws and regulations and the facilities and requirements of any Relevant
System concerned and these Articles, have power to implement and/or approve any arrangements they may, in their absolute discretion,
think fit in relation to the evidencing of title to and transfer of interests in shares in the Company in uncertificated form (including in the
form of depositary interests or similar interests, instruments or Securities), which may include arrangements restricting transfers, and to
the extent such arrangements are so implemented, no provision of these Articles shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any
respect inconsistent (as determined by the Directors in their absolute discretion) with the holding or transfer thereof or the shares in the
Company represented thereby. The Directors may from time to time take such actions and do such things as they may, in their absolute
discretion, think fit in relation to the operation of any such arrangements.

If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of a share they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer
was lodged with the Company, send to the transferor and the transferee notice of the refusal.

No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of transfer or, subject as otherwise herein provided, any other document
relating to or affecting the title to any share.

The Company shall be entitled to retain any instrument of transfer of a certificated share which is registered but any instrument of
transfer which the Directors refuse to register shall be returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is given.

No transfer of shares will be registered if, in the reasonable determination of the Directors, the transferee is or may be a Prohibited
Person, or the transferee is or may be holding such shares on behalf of a beneficial owner who is or may be a Prohibited Person.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

If a Member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, and his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or
the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest; but nothing
herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased Member from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by
him.

A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death, bankruptcy or incapacity of a Member may, upon such evidence
being produced as the Directors may properly require, elect either to become the holder of the share or to make such transfer thereof as
the deceased, bankrupt or incapacitated Member could have made. If he elects to become the holder he shall give notice to the Company
to that effect. If he elects to transfer the share he shall execute an instrument of transfer of the share to the transferee. All of the Articles
relating to the transfer of shares shall apply to the notice or instrument of transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer executed by the
Member and the death, bankruptcy or incapacity of the Member had not occurred.

A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death, bankruptcy or incapacity of a Member shall have the rights to which
he would be entitled if he were the holder of the share except that he shall not before being registered as the holder of the share be
entitled in respect of it to attend or vote at any meeting of the Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares
in the Company.

COMPULSORY TRANSFER

The Directors may require (to the extent permitted by the rules of any Relevant System where applicable) the transfer by lawful sale, by
gift or otherwise as permitted by law of any shares that, in the reasonable determination of the Directors, are or may be held or
beneficially owned by a Prohibited Person to another person who is not a Prohibited Person (including, without limitation, an existing
Member) qualified under these Articles to hold the shares. In the event that the Member cannot locate a purchaser qualified to acquire
and hold the shares within such reasonable time as the Directors may determine then the Company may seek to locate (but does not
guarantee that it will locate) an eligible purchaser of the shares and shall introduce the selling Member to such purchaser. If no
purchaser of the shares is found by the selling Member or located by the Company before the time the Company requires the transfer to
be made then the Member shall be obligated to sell the shares at the highest price that any purchaser has offered and the Member agrees
that the Company shall have no obligation to the Member to find the best price for the relevant shares.

The Directors may, from time to time, require of a Member that such evidence be furnished to them or any other person in connection
with establishing the eligibility of that Member to hold shares as provided in Article 13.1 above as they shall in their reasonable
discretion deem sufficient.

In the event that the Directors require the transfer of shares in accordance with Article 13.1 above the Directors will serve a notice (a
Transfer Notice ) on the relevant Member requiring such person within 28 (twenty eight) calendar days to transfer the applicable shares
to another person who, in the sole and conclusive judgment of the Directors is not a Prohibited Person. On and after the date of such
Transfer Notice, and until registration of a transfer of the applicable shares to which it relates the rights and privileges attaching to the
relevant shares will be suspended and not capable of exercise. To the extent permitted under any Relevant System, the Directors may
instruct the operator of such Relevant System to convert any uncertificated share which is subject to a Transfer Notice into certificated
form.

Members who do not comply with the terms of any Transfer Notice shall forfeit or be deemed to have forfeited their shares
immediately. The Directors, the Company and the duly authorised agents of the Company, including, without limitation, the registrar of
the Company, shall not be liable to any Member or otherwise for any loss incurred by the Company as a result of any Prohibited Person
breaching the compulsory transfer restrictions referred to herein and any Member who breaches such restrictions is required under these
Articles to indemnify the Company for any loss to the Company caused by such breach.

Without limitation to any of their powers under Article 6 the Directors may at any time and from time to time call upon any Member by
notice to provide them with such information and evidence as they shall reasonably require in relation to such Member or beneficial
owner which relates to or is connected with their holding of or interest in shares in the Company. In the event of any failure of the
relevant Member to comply with the request contained in such notice within a reasonable time as determined by the Directors in their
sole and unfettered discretion, the Directors may proceed to avail themselves of the rights conferred on them under these Articles as
though the relevant Member were a Prohibited Person.

ALTERATION OF SHARES

Subject to the Act, the Company may, pursuant to a Resolution of Directors obtained at any time prior to an Acquisition, or by a
Resolution of Members obtained at any time, undertake any action as is specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) below, at any time
following such Resolution of Directors or Resolution of Members:

(a) consolidate and divide all or any of its shares into a smaller number than its existing shares;

(b) sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of a larger number so, however, that in such sub-division the proportion
between the amount paid and the amount (if any) unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as in the case of the share
from which the reduced share is derived;

(c) cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been taken up or agreed to be taken up by any
person;
(d) convert all or any of its shares denominated in a particular currency or former currency into shares denominated in a different

currency, the conversion being effected at the rate of exchange (calculated to not less than three significant figures) current on
the date of the resolution or on such other dates as may be specified therein;

(e) where its shares are expressed in a particular currency or former currency, denominate or redenominate those shares, whether
by expressing the amount in units or subdivisions of that currency or former currency, or otherwise; and

(f) reduce any of the Company’s reserve accounts (including any share premium amount) in any manner.

Whenever as a result of a consolidation of shares any Members would become entitled to fractions of a share, the Directors may, in their
absolute discretion, on behalf of those Members, sell the shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable to any
person (including, subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proportion among
those Members. The Directors may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to or in accordance with the
directions of the purchaser. The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the
shares be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale.

DISTRIBUTIONS

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, authorise a distribution at a time and of an amount they think fit if they are satisfied,
on reasonable grounds, that, immediately after the distribution, the value of the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the
Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due. For the avoidance of doubt, the requirements of this Article 15.1 shall not apply
in respect of any issue of Ordinary Shares to the holders of Founder Preferred Shares in satisfaction of any Annual Dividend Amount to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Article 4.1.

Dividends may be paid in money, shares, or other property.

15.9

The Board may, before declaring any dividend, carry to reserve out of the profits of the Company (including any premiums received
upon the issue of debenture or other securities of the Company) such sums as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at
the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied, and pending
such application may, at the like discretion, either be employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as the
Board may from time to time think fit. The Board may also without placing the same to reserve carry forward any profits which they
may think prudent not to divide.

All dividends or other distributions (including but not limited to dividends or distributions declared and paid in accordance with Clauses
6.1 and 6.2 of the Memorandum and Articles 2.13 and 4.1) shall be declared and paid only in respect of paid up shares and the holder of
any share or shares not paid up as at the date such dividend is declared or such distribution is authorised shall not be entitled to such
dividend or distribution. For the purposes of calculating each holder’s pro rata share of any dividend or distribution paid, reference shall
only be had to paid up shares (as at the date the dividend is declared or the distribution authorised) of the class or classes to which the
dividend or distribution relates. If any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend or other distributions as from a
particular date, that share shall rank for dividend or other distribution accordingly.

Any Resolution of Directors declaring a dividend or a distribution on a share may specify that the same shall be payable to the person
registered as the holders of the shares at the close of business on a particular date notwithstanding that it may be a date prior to that on
which the resolution is passed and thereupon the dividend or distribution shall be payable to such persons in accordance with their
respective holdings so registered, but without prejudice to the rights inter se in respect of such dividend or distribution of transferors and
transferees of any such shares.

Any Resolution of Directors declaring a dividend or other distribution may direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the
distribution of assets, may authorise the issue fractional certificates, may fix the value for distribution of any assets and may determine
that cash shall be paid to any Member upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of Members and may vest any
assets in trustees.

Notice in writing of any dividend that may have been declared shall be given to each Member in accordance with Article 40 and all
unclaimed dividends or other distributions may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the Company
until claimed and the Company shall not be constituted a trustee thereof. All dividends unclaimed for 3 years after notice shall have
been given to a Member may be forfeited by Resolution of Directors for the benefit of the Company, and shall cease to remain owing by
the Company.

Any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of a share may be paid by electronic transfer or cheque sent by post to the registered
address (or in the case of a Depositary, subject to the approval of the Board, such persons and addresses as the Depositary may require)
of the person entitled or, if two or more persons are the holders of the share or are jointly entitled to it by reason of the death or
bankruptcy of the holder, to the registered address of the one of those persons who is first named in the register of Members or to such
person and to such address as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct (and in default of which direction to that one of the
persons jointly so entitled as the Directors shall in their absolute discretion determine). Every cheque shall be made payable to the order
of the person or persons entitled or to such other person as the person or persons entitled may in writing direct and payment of the
cheque shall be a good discharge to the Company. Any joint holder or other person jointly entitled to a share as aforesaid may give
receipts for any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share. Every cheque is sent at the risk of the person entitled to the
payment. If payment is made by electronic transfer, the Company is not responsible for amounts lost or delayed in the course of making
that payment.

The Directors may deduct from any dividend or distribution or other monies, payable to any Member on or in respect of a share, all
sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls or otherwise in relation to the shares.

No dividend or distribution or other moneys payable in respect of a share shall bear interest against the Company unless otherwise
provided by the rights attached to the share and no dividend shall be paid on Treasury Shares.

If, in respect of a dividend or other distribution or other amount payable in respect of a share, on any one occasion:
(a) a cheque is returned undelivered or left uncashed; or
(b) an electronic transfer is not accepted,

and reasonable enquiries have failed to establish another address or account of the person entitled to the payment, the Company is not
obliged to send or transfer a dividend or other amount payable in respect of that share to that person until he notifies the Company of an
address or account to be used for that purpose. If the cheque is returned undelivered or left uncashed or transfer not accepted on two
consecutive occasions, the Company may exercise this power without making any such enquiries.

REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own shares with the consent of the Member whose shares are to
be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired.

The purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the Company of its own shares is deemed not to be a distribution where:

(a) the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires the shares pursuant to a right of a Member to have his shares
redeemed or to have his shares exchanged for money or other property of the Company, or

(b) the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires the shares by virtue of the provisions of section 176 of the Act.
Sections 60, 61 and 62 of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to this Article may be cancelled or held as Treasury Shares
except to the extent that such shares are in excess of 50 (fifty) per cent. of the issued shares of that class in which case they shall be
cancelled but they shall be available for reissue.

All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be exercised by the Company while it holds the
share as a Treasury Share.

Treasury Shares may be disposed of by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise inconsistent with the Memorandum
and Articles) as the Company may by Resolution of Directors determine.

Where shares are held by another body corporate of which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, shares having more than 50 (fifty)
per cent. of the votes in the election of directors of the other body corporate, all rights and obligations attaching to the shares held by the
other body corporate are suspended and shall not be exercised by the other body corporate.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF SHARES

A Member may by an instrument in writing mortgage or charge his shares.

There shall be entered in the register of Members at the written request of the Member:
(a) a statement that the shares held by him are mortgaged or charged;

(b) the name of the mortgagee or chargee; and

(c) the date on which the particulars specified in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) are entered in the register of Members.
Where particulars of a mortgage or charge are entered in the register of Members, such particulars may be cancelled:
(a) with the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorised to act on his behalf; or

(b) upon evidence satisfactory to the Directors of the discharge of the liability secured by the mortgage or charge and the issue of
such indemnities as the Directors shall consider necessary or desirable.

Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge over shares are entered in the register of Members pursuant to this Article:

(a) no transfer of any share the subject of those particulars shall be effected;
(b) the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such share; and
(c) no replacement certificate shall be issued in respect of such shares,

without the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF MEMBERS

The Company shall hold the first annual general meeting within a period of 18 months following the date of an Acquisition. Not more
than 15 months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting and the date of the next, unless such period is extended, or
such requirement is waived, by a Resolution of Members.

Any Director may convene meetings of the Members at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin
Islands as the Director considers necessary or desirable.

Upon the written request of Members entitled to exercise 30 (thirty) per cent. or more of the voting rights in respect of the matter for
which the meeting is requested the Directors shall convene a meeting of Members.

The Director convening a meeting shall give not less than 10 (ten) calendar days’ written notice of a meeting of Members to:
(a) those Members who are entitled to vote at the meeting; and
(b) the other Directors.

A meeting of Members held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if Members holding at least 90 (ninety) per cent.
of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the
presence of a Member at the meeting shall constitute a waiver in relation to all the shares which that Member holds.

The inadvertent failure of a Director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a Member or another Director, or the fact
that a Member or another Director has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

If the Board, in its absolute discretion, considers that it is impractical or unreasonable for any reason to hold a meeting of Members at
the time or place specified in the notice calling the meeting of Members, it may move and/or postpone the meeting of Members to
another time and/or place. Notice of the business to be transacted at such moved and/or postponed meeting is not required. The Board
must take reasonable steps to ensure that Members trying to attend the meeting of Members at the original time and/or place are
informed of the new arrangements for the meeting of Members. Proxy forms can be delivered as specified in Article 20.10 until 48
(forty eight) hours before the rearranged meeting. Any postponed and/or moved meeting may also be postponed and/or moved under
this Article.

PROCEEDINGS AT MEETINGS OF MEMBERS
The quorum of any meeting of Members shall be one Member present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote.

A Member shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of Members if he participates by telephone or other electronic means and all
Members participating in the meeting are able to hear or read what is said or communicated by each other.

If a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting (or such longer period as the chairman of the
meeting may think fit and allow), or if during a meeting such a quorum ceases to be present, the meeting, if convened by or upon the
requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. If otherwise convened, it shall stand adjourned to such day, time and place as the chairman
may determine or as otherwise may be specified in the original notice of meeting and, if at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not
present within five minutes from the time appointed for the holding of the meeting, those Members present in person or by proxy shall
be a quorum.

The chairman may invite any person to attend and speak at any meeting of Members of the Company where he considers this will assist
in the deliberations of the meeting. The Directors may attend and speak at any meeting of Members and at any separate meeting of the
holders of any class or series of shares.

The notice of meeting may also specify a time (which shall not be more than 48 (forty eight) hours before the time fixed for the
meeting) by which a person must be entered on the register of Members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting.
Changes to entries on the register of Members after the time so specified in the notice shall be disregarded in determining the rights of
any person to so attend or vote.

The Directors may determine that those persons who are entered on the register of Members at the close of business on a day
determined by the Directors (which may not be more than 21 (twenty one) calendar days before the date on which the notices of
meeting were sent) shall be the persons who are entitled to receive notice.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from place to place. When a meeting is
adjourned for 14 (fourteen) calendar days or more, at least 7 (seven) calendar days’ notice shall be given specifying the day, time and
place of the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Otherwise it shall not be necessary to give any
such notice.

At any meeting of Members, the chairman (if any) of the Board or, if he is absent or unwilling, one of the other Directors who is
appointed for that purpose by the Directors or (failing appointment by the Directors) by the Members present, shall preside as chairman
of the meeting. If none of the Directors are present or are present but unwilling to preside, the Members present and entitled to vote
shall choose one of their number to preside as chairman of the meeting.

At any meeting of the Members the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he considers appropriate whether any
resolution proposed has been carried or not and the result of his decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes
of the meeting. If the chairman has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken of
all votes cast upon such resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any Member present in person or by proxy who disputes the
announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken
and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken. If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and
recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

The demand for a poll may be withdrawn before the poll is taken but only with the consent of the chairman. A demand so withdrawn
shall not be taken to have invalidated the result of a show of hands declared before the demand was made.

A poll shall be taken as the chairman directs and he may appoint scrutineers (who need not be Members) and fix a day, time and place
for declaring the result of the poll. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was
demanded.

A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other
question shall be taken either forthwith or at such day, time and place as the chairman directs not being more than 30 (thirty) calendar
days after the poll is demanded. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business
other than the question on which the poll was demanded. If a poll is demanded before the declaration of the result of a show of hands
and the demand is duly withdrawn, the meeting shall continue as if the demand had not been made.

No notice need be given of a poll not taken forthwith if the day, time and place at which it is to be taken are announced at the meeting at
which it is demanded. In any other case at least 7 (seven) calendar days’ notice shall be given specifying the day, time and place at
which the poll is to be taken.

In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman shall not be entitled to a casting vote in
addition to any other vote he may have.

The provisions of this Article 19 in relation to any meeting of Members shall apply equally to any separate meeting of a class of
Members.

VOTES OF MEMBERS
Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares and to the provisions of the Articles:

(a) on a show of hands every Member who is present in person (or in the case of corporations, present by a duly authorised
representative) or by proxy shall have one vote; and

(b) on a poll every Member present in person (or in the case of corporations, present by a duly authorised representative) or by
proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he is the holder.

The following applies where shares are jointly owned:

(a) if two or more persons hold shares jointly each of them may be present in person or by proxy at a meeting of Members and
may speak as a Member;

(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf of all joint owners; and

(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one and in the event of disagreement

between any of the joint owners of shares then the vote of the joint owner whose name appears first (or earliest) in the register
of Members in respect of the relevant shares shall be recorded as the vote attributable to the shares.

A Member in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction (whether in the British Virgin Islands or
elsewhere) in matters concerning mental disorder may vote, whether by a show of hands or by a poll, by his attorney, receiver or other
person authorised in that behalf appointed by that court, and any such attorney, receiver or other person may vote by proxy. Evidence to
the satisfaction of the Board of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be deposited at the office, or at
such other place within the British Virgin Islands as is specified in accordance with these Articles for the deposit of instruments of
proxy, before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or the holding of a poll at which the right to vote is to be
exercised and in default the right to vote shall not be exercisable.

Unless the Directors otherwise decide, no Member shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of Members or at any separate meeting of the
holders of any class of shares in the Company, either in person or by proxy, in respect of any share held by him or to exercise rights as a
holder of shares unless all calls and other sums presently payable by him in respect of shares of which he is the holder or one of the joint
holders have been paid.

No Member shall, if the Directors so determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him to attend or vote (either personally or by
representative or by proxy) at any meeting of Members or separate class meeting of the Company or to exercise any other right
conferred by membership in relation to any such meeting if he or any other person appearing to be interested in such shares has failed to
comply with a Disclosure Notice within 14 (fourteen) calendar days, in a case where the shares in question represent at least 0.25
(nought point two five) per cent. of their class, or within 7 (seven) calendar days, in any other case, from the date of such Disclosure
Notice. These restrictions will continue until the information required by the notice is supplied to the Company or until the shares in
question are transferred or sold in circumstances specified for this purpose in these Articles.

No objection shall be raised to the entitlement of any voter or to any person to vote as he did except at the meeting or adjourned meeting
or poll at which the vote objected to is or may be tendered, and every vote not disallowed at such meeting or poll shall be valid for all
purposes. Any such objection made in due time shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting whose decision shall be final and
conclusive.

On a poll, a person entitled to more than one vote need not if he votes, use all his votes or cast all votes he uses in the same way.

A Member may appoint another person as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of
the Company. A proxy need not be a Member. A Member may appoint more than one proxy to attend on the same occasion, provided
that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him. When two or more valid but
differing appointments of proxy are delivered or received for the same share for use at the same meeting, the one which is last validly
delivered or received (regardless of its date or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as
regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine which appointment was last validly delivered or received, none of them shall
be treated as valid in respect of that share.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing in any usual form (or in another form approved by the Board) under the hand of
the appointer or his attorney duly authorised in writing or if the appointer is a corporation, either under its common seal or under the
hand of an officer or attorney so authorised.

The instrument appointing a proxy and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified
copy of such power or authority shall be:

(a) delivered to the Office or at such other place as is specified for that purpose in the notice of meeting or in the instrument of
proxy issued by the Company not less than 48 (forty eight) hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or
adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote;

(b) given by email or any other electronic method to the address of the Company specified for that purpose in the notice of the
meeting or in the instrument of proxy issued by the Company not less than 48 (forty eight) hours before the time for holding
the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote and subject to the need to
deposit any power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which an instrument of proxy is signed, an instrument so given
shall be deemed to be duly deposited. However any power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which an instrument of
proxy is executed, or a notarially certified copy of such power or authority, shall not be given by email or any other electronic
method;

(c) in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it is demanded, delivered as required by sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Article 20.10 not less than 24 (twenty four) hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll; or

(d) in the case of a poll not taken immediately but taken not more than 48 (forty eight) hours after it was demanded, the time at
which it was demanded,

and in default and unless the Board directs otherwise, the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid.

No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 12 months from the date named in it as the date of its execution,
except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally
held within 12 months from such date. Notwithstanding this Article, the Directors may, at their discretion, accept the appointment of a
proxy at any time prior to holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote.

Without limiting the foregoing, in relation to any shares which are held in uncertificated form, the Board may from time to time permit
appointments of a proxy to be made by means of an uncertificated proxy instruction and may in a similar manner permit supplements to,
or amendments or revocations of, any such uncertificated proxy instruction to be made by like means. The Board may in addition
prescribe the method of determining the time at which any such uncertificated proxy instruction (and/or other instruction or notification)
is to be treated as received by the Company or a participant acting on its behalf. The Board may treat any such uncertificated proxy
instruction which purports to be or is expressed to be sent on behalf of a holder of a share as sufficient evidence of the authority of the
person sending that instruction to send it on behalf of that holder.

A vote given or poll demanded in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the death or
insanity of the principal or the revocation or determination of the instrument of proxy or of the authority under which the instrument of
proxy was executed or the transfer of the share in respect of which the instrument of proxy is given, provided that no intimation in
writing of such death, insanity, revocation or determination shall have been received by the Company at the office or at such other place
at which the instrument of proxy was duly deposited before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote
is given or the poll demanded or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the
time appointed for taking the poll.

Notwithstanding anything contained in these Articles, and subject to such being permissible under the Law, the Directors of the
Company may elect to provide a facility for using electronic voting and polling by the holders for any purpose deemed appropriate by
the Directors, including without limitation, the polling of holders and electronic voting by holders at any meeting of Members.

Any vote given by proxy may be given by email or any other electronic method (including any instruction or message under a Relevant
System) to the address of the Company or person nominated by the Company and specified for that purpose in the notice of meeting or
in the instrument of proxy issued by the Company (unless using a Relevant System in which case such message may be received by the
Company’s agent) and, with the exception of votes cast using a Relevant System subject to the need to deposit any power of attorney or
other authority (if any) under which a vote given by proxy is made, a vote so given shall be deemed to be duly made. However, any
power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which a vote given by proxy is made, or a notarially certified copy of such power or
authority, shall not be given by email or any other electronic method.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Article for the appointment of representatives of Members other than individuals the
right of any individual to speak for or represent a Member shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the
documents by which, the Member is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the Directors may in good faith seek legal
advice and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the Directors may rely and act upon such advice
without incurring any liability to any Member or the Company.

Any corporation which is a Member may, by resolution of its Board or other governing body or officers authorised by such body,
authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of the
holders of shares of any class of Members, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the
corporation which he represents as that corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member. A corporation present at any
meeting by such representative shall be deemed for the purposes of these Articles to be present in person.

The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Member other than an individual may at the meeting
but not thereafter call for a notarially certified copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced within 7 (seven) calendar days
of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such Member shall be disregarded.

An action that may be taken by the Members at a meeting may also be taken by a Resolution of Members consented to in writing,
without the need for any prior notice. If any Resolution of Members is adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all
Members, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent to all Members not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the
form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Members. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the
counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the earliest date upon which Eligible Persons holding a
sufficient number of votes of shares to constitute a Resolution of Members have consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

SQUEEZE OUT PROVISIONS
Section 176 of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

The first Directors shall be appointed by the first registered agent within 30 (thirty) calendar days of the incorporation of the Company
and, thereafter, the Directors shall be elected by Resolution of Members or by Resolution of Directors for such term as the Members or
Directors, as applicable, determine.

No person shall be appointed as a Director unless he has consented in writing to act as a Director.

The minimum number of Directors shall be one and there shall be no maximum number of Directors.

ALTERNATE DIRECTORS

Any Director (other than an alternate Director) may by notice sent to or deposited at the office or tabled at the meeting of the Board or
in any other manner approved by the Board appoint any other Director or any other person to be an alternate Director to attend and vote
in his place at any meeting of the Directors at which he is not personally present or to undertake and perform such duties and functions
and to exercise such rights as he would personally.

Any such appointment may be made generally or specifically or for any period or for any particular meeting and with and subject to any
particular restrictions. An alternate Director need not be a Member.

A Director may by notice delivered to the office or tabled at a meeting of the Board revoke the appointment of his alternate Director
and, subject to the provisions of this Article 23, appoint another person in his place. If a Director ceases to hold the office of Director or
if he dies, the appointment of his alternate Director automatically ceases. If a Director retires but is reappointed or deemed reappointed
at the meeting at which his retirement takes effect, a valid appointment of an alternate Director which was in force immediately before
his retirement continues to operate after his reappointment as if he has not retired. The appointment of an alternate Director ceases on
the happening of an event which, if he were a Director otherwise appointed, would cause him to vacate office.

Every alternate Director while he holds office as such shall be entitled:

(a) if his appointor so directs the secretary to notice of meetings of the Directors and all committees of the Board of which his
appointor is a member;

(b) to attend and to exercise (subject to any restrictions) all the rights and privileges of his appointor at all such meetings at which
his appointor is not personally present; and

(c) to sign written resolutions on behalf of his appointor.

A Director acting as alternate Director has a separate vote at meetings of the Board and committees of the Board for each Director for
whom he acts as alternate Director but he counts as only one for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

Without prejudice to Article 23.3 every alternate Director shall ipso facto vacate office if and when his appointment expires by effluxion
of time.

Save as otherwise provided in these Articles, an alternate Director shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be
responsible for his own acts and defaults and he shall not be deemed to be the agent of the Director appointing him.

POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of, the Directors. The Directors
have all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The Directors
may pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the Company and may exercise all such
powers of the Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Members.

The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

Subject as hereinafter provided, the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow or raise money (including the
power to borrow for the purpose of redeeming shares) and secure any debt or obligation of or binding on the Company in any manner
including by the issue of debentures (perpetual or otherwise) and to secure the repayment of any money borrowed raised or owing by
mortgage charge pledge or lien upon the whole or any part of the Company’s undertaking property or assets (whether present or future)
and also by a similar mortgage charge pledge or lien to secure and guarantee the performance of any obligation or liability undertaken
by the Company or any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts for moneys paid to the
Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the case may be, in such manner as shall from time to
time be determined by Resolution of Directors.

Section 175 of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS’ POWERS

The Directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of one or more Directors, and
delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal, to the committee. They may also delegate to any other
Director (whether holding any other executive office or not) such of their powers as they consider desirable to be exercised by him. Any
such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the Directors may impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of their
own powers and may be revoked or altered. Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of a committee shall be governed by the
Articles regulating the proceedings of Directors so far as they are capable of applying and so far as the same are not superseded by any
provisions in the Resolution of Directors establishing the committee, provided that it is not necessary to give notice of a meeting of that
committee to Directors other than the Director or Directors who form the committee.

in the Act).

Articles 25.1 and 25.2 do not prevent a committee of Directors, where authorised by the Resolution of Directors appointing such
committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the
committee to the sub-committee.

The Directors may, by power of attorney signed by any one or more persons duly authorised, appoint any person either generally or in
respect of any specific matter, to represent the Company, act in its name and execute documents on its behalf.

APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS

Subject to the Act and these Articles, the Directors shall have power from time to time, without sanction of the Members, to appoint any
person to be a Director, either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director. A vacancy in relation to Directors occurs if a Director
dies or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to the expiration of his term of office.

Subject to the Act and these Articles, the Members may by a Resolution of Members appoint any person as a Director and there shall be
no requirement for the appointment of two or more Directors to be considered separately.

A Director is appointed for such term as may be specified in the Resolution of Directors or Resolution of Members appointing him.
Where the Directors appoint a person as Director to fill a vacancy, such replacement Director may be appointed for any term as the
Directors in their discretion determine.

Each Director holds office for the term, if any, fixed by the Resolution of Members or Resolution of Directors appointing or otherwise
provided for in the relevant Director’s service agreement or letter of appointment (if applicable), or until his earlier death, resignation or
removal. If no term is fixed on the appointment of a Director, the Director serves indefinitely until his earlier death, resignation or
removal.

A person must not be appointed a Director unless he has in writing consented to being a Director of the Company.

A Director may resign his office by giving written notice of his resignation to the Company and the resignation has effect from the date
the notice is received by the Company at the office of its registered agent or from such later date as may be specified in the notice,
provided in both instances that such resignation is in accordance with the terms of the relevant Director’s service agreement or letter of
appointment (if applicable). A Director shall resign forthwith as a Director if he is, or becomes, disqualified from acting as a Director
under the Act.

A Director is not required to hold a share as a qualification to office.

and for the purposes of this Article 27.1, Section 114 of the Act shall not apply.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION AND EXPENSES
The Directors shall be remunerated for their services at such rate as the Directors shall determine.

The Directors may grant special remuneration to any Director who, being so called upon, shall be willing to render any special or extra
services to the Company. Such special remuneration may be made payable to such Director in addition to or in substitution for his
ordinary remuneration as a Director and may be made payable by a lump sum or by way of salary or commission or by any or all of
those models or otherwise.

The Directors may be paid:

(a) all reasonable travelling, hotel and other out of pocket expenses properly incurred by them in connection with their attendance
at meetings of Directors or committees of Directors or meetings of Members or separate meetings of the holders of any class
of shares or of debentures of the Company or otherwise in connection with the discharge of their duties; and

The officers of the Company shall hold office until their death, resignation or removal. Any officer elected or appointed by the directors
may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by Resolution of Directors. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company
may be filled by Resolution of Directors.

Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Directors may appoint one or more of their number to the office of managing director or to any
other executive office in the Company and may enter into an agreement or arrangement with any Director for his employment by the

services as they determine.

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, appoint any person, including a person who is a Director, to be an agent of the
Company. An agent of the Company shall have such powers and authority of the Directors, including the power and authority to affix
the Seal, as are set forth in the Articles or in the Resolution of Directors appointing the agent, except that no agent has any power or
authority with respect to the matters specified in Article 25.2. The Resolution of Directors appointing an agent may authorise the agent
to appoint one or more substitutes or delegates to exercise some or all of the powers conferred on the agent by the Company. The
Directors may remove an agent appointed by the Company and may revoke or vary a power conferred on him.

DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS

A Director shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the
Company, disclose the interest to all other Directors.

For the purposes of Article 30.1, a disclosure to all other Directors to the effect that a Director is a member, director or officer of
another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in
any transaction which may, after the date of the entry or disclosure, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient
disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.

Subject to any applicable rules or regulations, a Director who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the
Company may:

(a) vote on a matter relating to the transaction;

(b) attend a meeting of Directors at which a matter relating to the transaction arises and be included among the Directors present
at the meeting for the purposes of a quorum; and

(c) sign a document on behalf of the Company, or do any other thing in his capacity as a Director, that relates to the transaction,

and, subject to compliance with the Act shall not, by reason of his office be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he
derives from such transaction and no such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.

DIRECTORS’ GRATUITIES AND PENSIONS

The Directors may provide benefits, whether by the payment of gratuities or pensions or by insurance or otherwise, for any Director

who has held but no longer holds any executive office or employment with the Company or with any body corporate which is or has
been a subsidiary of the Company or a predecessor in business of the Company or of any such subsidiary, and for any member of his
family (including a spouse and a former spouse) or any person who is or who was dependent on him, and may (as well before as after he
ceases to hold such office or employment) contribute to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of any such benefit.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may regulate their proceedings as they think fit. A Director may, and the
secretary at the request of a Director shall, call a meeting of the Directors by notifying each other Director in writing or otherwise.
Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes the chairman shall have a
second or casting vote. A Director who is also an alternate Director shall be entitled to a separate vote for each Director for whom he
acts as alternate in addition to his own vote.

A Director shall be given not less than 48 (forty eight) hours notice of meetings of Directors. A meeting of Directors held without 48
(forty eight) hours notice having been given to all Directors shall be valid if all the Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not
attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver by that
Director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director has not received the notice, does not
invalidate the meeting.

The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be fixed by the Directors and unless so fixed at any other number
shall be two except where there is a sole Director, in which case the quorum shall be one. A person who is an alternate Director shall be
counted in the quorum and any Director acting as an alternate Director shall also be counted as one for each of the Directors for whom
he acts as alternate.

The Directors or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin
Islands as the notice calling the meeting provides.

A meeting of Directors may be held notwithstanding that such Directors may not be in the same place if a Director is, by any means, in
communication with one or more other Directors so that each Director participating in the communication can hear or read what is said
or communicated by each of the others and any such meeting shall be deemed to be held in the place in which the chairman of the
meeting is present and each such Director shall be deemed to be present at such meeting and shall be counted when reckoning a
quorum.

The continuing Directors or the only continuing Director may act notwithstanding any vacancies in their number, but, if the number of
Directors is less than the number fixed as the quorum, the continuing Directors or Director may act only for the purpose of filling
vacancies or of calling a meeting of Members. In lieu of minutes of a meeting a sole continuing Director shall record in writing and sign
a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of
such resolution for all purposes.

The Directors may appoint one of their number to be the chairman of the Board and may at any time remove him from that office.
Unless he is unwilling to do so, the Directors so appointed shall preside at every meeting of Directors at which he is present. But if there
is no Director holding that office, or if the Directors holding it is unwilling to preside or is not present within five minutes after the time
appointed for the meeting, the Directors present may appoint one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

All acts done by a meeting of Directors, or of a committee of Directors, or by a person acting as a Director shall, notwithstanding that it
be afterwards discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any Director or that any of them were disqualified from holding
office, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified.

An action that may be taken by the Directors or a committee of Directors at a meeting may also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or
a resolution of a committee of Directors consented to in writing by such majority of Directors or by such majority of the members of the
committee, as the case may be, as would have been required to approve such Resolution of Directors or such resolution of a committee
of the Directors at a duly convened meeting of Directors or the Committee as applicable without the need for any notice. The consent
may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more

Directors. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on
the date upon which the last Director has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

The Company shall keep a register of Directors containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the persons who are Directors;

(b) the date on which each person whose name is entered in the register was appointed as a Director;

(c) the date on which each person named as a Director ceased to be a Director; and

(d) such other information as may be prescribed by the Act and/or any applicable law, rules and regulations.

The register of Directors may be kept in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic, electronic or other data
storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its contents. Until a Resolution of Directors determining
otherwise is passed, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage shall be the original register of Directors.

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company may indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative
proceedings any person who:

(a) is Or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a Director; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The indemnity in Article 33.1 only applies if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the
Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the Directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the
Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud,
sufficient for the purposes of the Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself,
create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that
the person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a Director, officer or liquidator of the
Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or
was acting for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person
and incurred by the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power to indemnify the person
against the liability as provided in the Articles.

CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS

The Directors may by a Resolution of Directors:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

resolve to capitalise any undistributed profits of the Company or any part of the amount for the time being standing to the
credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts (including a capital reserve, profit and loss account or revenue reserve) or
subject as hereinafter provided any such amount standing to the credit of a share premium account or capital redemption
reserve fund, whether or not available for distribution;

appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the Members who, in the case of any amount capable of being distributed by
way of dividend, would have been entitled thereto if so distributed or, in the case of any amount not so capable, to the
Members who would have been entitled thereto on a winding-up of the Company and in either case in the same proportions
and apply that sum on their behalf in or towards:

(1) paying up the amounts (if any) for the time being unpaid on shares held by them respectively, or
(ii) paying up in full unissued shares or debentures of an amount equal to that sum,

and allot the shares or debentures, credited as paid up, to the Members (or as they may direct) in those proportions, or partly
in one way and partly in the other;

make any arrangements it thinks fit to resolve a difficulty arising in the distribution of a capitalised reserve and in particular,
without limitation, where shares or debentures become distributable in fractions the Board may deal with the fractions as it
thinks fit, including issuing fractional certificates, disregarding fractions or selling shares or debentures representing the
fractions to a person for the best price reasonably obtainable and distributing the net proceeds of the sale in due proportion
amongst the Members (except that if the amount due to a Member is less than £10, or such other sum as the Board may
decide, the sum may be retained for the benefit of the Company);

authorise a person to enter (on behalf of all the Members concerned) an agreement with the Company providing for either:

(i) the allotment to the Members respectively, credited as paid up, of shares or debentures to which they may be entitled
on the capitalisation; or

(ii) the payment by the Company on behalf of the Members (by the application of their respective proportions of the
reserves resolved to be capitalised) of the amounts or part of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares,

an agreement made under the authority being effective and binding on all those Members; and

generally do all acts and things required to give effect to the resolution.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, but subject to the rights attached to shares, the Board may fix any date as the
record date for a dividend, distribution, allotment or issue. The record date may be on or at any time before or after a date on which the
dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is declared, made or paid.

Following any determination by the Directors pursuant to Article 41.1 to recommend that the Company be wound up or that the
Company continues to pursue an Acquisition for another year, the Directors shall propose or cause to be proposed either at a meeting of

the Directors shall as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter propose or cause to be proposed either at a meeting of Members or in
writing a further Resolution of Members to the effect that the Company shall be wound up. If any such resolution is not approved, the
Directors may thereafter (at any time and from time to time) propose or cause to be proposed either at a meeting of Members or in
writing a Resolution of Members to voluntarily wind up the Company.

The Directors may by a Resolution of Directors approve the winding up of the Company to occur at any time after an Acquisition has
been completed and when the Directors reasonably conclude that the Company is or will become a Dormant Company. For the
avoidance of doubt such Resolution of Directors may, subject to the Act, be approved at any time, including prior to completion of an
Acquisition.

Directors pursuant to this Article 41 or Article 43, the Company shall proceed to be wound-up in accordance with section 199 of the
Act.

MERGER AND CONSOLIDATION

Subject to Article 42.2, the Company may, with the approval of a Resolution of Members, on which only the holders of Founder
Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote (such resolution to be obtained prior to an Acquisition), merge or consolidate with one or more
other BVI or foreign companies, in the manner provided in the Act.

Except in relation to a Resolution of Members obtained prior to an Acquisition pursuant to Article 42.1, only the holders of Ordinary
Shares shall be entitled to vote on a Resolution of Members to approve the merger or consolidation of the Company with one or more
other BVI or foreign companies.

A Resolution of Members (either pursuant to Article 42.1 or otherwise) shall not (unless the Law requires otherwise) be required in
relation to a merger of a parent company with one or more subsidiary companies (each as defined in section 169 of the Act) in
accordance with section 172 of the Act.

ACQUISITION

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Articles, but subject to compliance with the Law, any matters which the Directors
consider it is necessary or desirable to approve in relation to, in connection with or resulting from an Acquisition (whether before or
after the Acquisition has occurred), which for the avoidance of doubt shall include in respect of any continuation of the Company under
the laws of a jurisdiction outside the British Virgin Islands in the manner provided under those laws, and/or the admission to listing and
trading of any class(es) of the Company’s Securities (or interests therein) on the New York Stock Exchange or such other stock
exchange as the directors may in their discretion determine, may be approved at any time by a Resolution of Directors or, to the extent a
resolution of Members is required pursuant to the Law, upon the approval of a Resolution of Members (on which only the holders of
Founder Preferred Shares shall be entitled to vote).

General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

FOURTH.

A. CLASSES OF STOCK.

1. Capital Stock . The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is two
hundred five million (205,000,000) shares, divided into: (i) two hundred million (200,000,000) shares, par value $0.01 per share, of
common stock (the “ Common Stock ”’); and (ii) five million (5,000,000) shares, par value $0.01 per share, of preferred stock (the “
Preferred Stock’), of which two million (2,000,000) shares are designated as “Series A Preferred Stock” (the “ Series A Preferred Stock
”),

2. Additional Series of Preferred Stock . The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “ Board of Directors ”’) is hereby expressly
authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, to provide from time to time out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock for one or more
series of Preferred Stock, and, with respect to each such series, to fix the number of shares constituting such series and the designation of
such series, the powers (including voting powers), if any, of the shares of such series and the preferences and relative, participating,
optional, special or other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, if any, of the shares of such series. The
designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other rights of each series of Preferred Stock, if any, and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any and all other series of Preferred Stock at any time
outstanding. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares
thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote irrespective of Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
without the separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock as a class.

dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock at such times and in such amounts as the Board of Directors in its discretion

the terms of a series of Preferred Stock) or by applicable law, each holder of Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to one (1) vote for
each share of Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote, and no
holder of any series of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled to any voting powers in respect thereof.

3. Liquidation Rights . Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of the Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares of
Common Stock held by them. A merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, or a sale or
conveyance of all or any part of the assets of the Corporation (which shall not in fact result in the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation and the distribution of assets to its stockholders) shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation within the meaning of this Section 3 .

this Agreement.

(d) by PAHL, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
the Fiduciaries set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or
Section 7.2 not to be satisfied and (11) either cannot be cured or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (A) the fifteenth calendar day following
receipt the Fiduciaries of written notice of such breach from PAHL and (B) the calendar day immediately prior to the End Date;

(e) by the Fiduciaries, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of PAHL set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (1) would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or
Section 7.3 not to be satisfied and (11) either cannot be cured or has not been cured prior to the earlier of (A) the fifteenth calendar day following
receipt by PAHL of written notice of such breach from the Fiduciaries and (B) the calendar day immediately prior to the End Date;

8.2 Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by PAHL under Section 8.1(c) or
under Section 8.1(d) with respect solely to a breach or failure to perform that would cause the conditions in Section 7.2 not to be satisfied, PAHL

be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

9.4 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among

that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, termination, performance or
nonperformance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed and construed in accordance
with the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a contract entered into and fully performed solely within the State of
Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

9.7 Except as expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

9.8 Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for recognition and
enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by another party hereto or its successors or permitted assigns shall be brought and
determined exclusively in any state court or Federal court sitting in New Castle County, Delaware and each of the parties hereto hereby
(1) irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in the event any dispute arises out of or relates to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby in
any court other than any state court or Federal court sitting in New Castle County, Delaware. It is understood and agreed that any other court or
arbiter in any other jurisdiction shall be entitled to enforce any judgment of any state court or Federal court sitting in New Castle County,
Delaware. Any writs, process or summonses to be served on any other party in such action or proceeding may be made by delivery of process in
accordance with the notice provisions contained in Section 9.2 or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (i) the defense of sovereign immunity, (ii) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this Section 9.8, (iii) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by law that
(A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

9.9 The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the party seeking the injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law.

PART I
INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

Item 20. Indemnification of Directors and Officers

Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL permits a corporation, in its certificate of incorporation, to limit or eliminate the liability of a director to the
corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

Under Section 145 of the DGCL, a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that
the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation (or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) against expenses (including attorneys’
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person if he acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In the case of an action brought by or in the right of a corporation, the corporation may
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any such threatened, pending or completed action by reason of
the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation (or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) only against expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action if he acted in good faith and
in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification may be made
in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the
extent the appropriate court finds that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for
such expenses as the court shall deem proper.

The new Platform Delaware certificate of incorporation provides that no director of Platform Delaware shall be liable to Platform
Delaware or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director except to the extent that such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as currently in effect or as the same may hereafter be amended. This provision in
the certificate of incorporation does not eliminate the directors’ fiduciary duties, and in appropriate circumstances, equitable remedies such as
injunctive or other forms of nonmonetary relief will remain available under Delaware law. In addition, each director will be subject to liability
for breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to Platform Delaware, for acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct, for
knowing violations of law, for actions leading to improper personal benefit to the director, and for payment of dividends or approval of stock
repurchases or redemptions that are unlawful under Delaware law. The provision also does not affect a director’s responsibilities under any other
law, such as the federal securities laws or state or federal environmental laws.

The new Platform Delaware by-laws also provide that Platform Delaware shall indemnify and advance expenses to its officers and
directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. For purposes of the indemnification described in this paragraph, references to Platform
Delaware include Platform Specialty Products Corporation as incorporated under British Virgin Islands law prior to the continuance of its
existence under Delaware law as Platform Delaware. Platform Delaware will remain obligated on any indemnification obligations of Platform
BVI arising prior to the Domestication.

harmless to the full extent authorized by the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

Item 22. Undertakings
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:
(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:
(a) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;

(b) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in
the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value
of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum
offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the
changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of
Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and

(c) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
or any material change to such information in the registration statement.

(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be
deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(3) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)
as part of the registration statement shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after
effectiveness; provided , however , that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or
made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration
statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the
registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of
first use.

(4) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the registrants, the registrants have been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is
against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the
payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrants in the successful defense of
any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, each
registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by
the final adjudication of such issue.

(6) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supply, by means of a post-effective amendment, all information concerning a
transaction, and the company being acquired involved therein, that was not the subject of and included in the registration statement when it
became effective.

(7) That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
distribution of the securities, if a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant is deemed to occur pursuant to this registration
statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, and if the securities are deemed to be offered or sold
to such purchaser by

IIl-4
Table of Contents

means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell
such securities to such purchaser:

(1) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to
Rule 424;

(i) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to
by the undersigned registrant;

(1i1) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and

(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.
