consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered

Directors and in the case of uncertificated Shares subject also to the facilities and
requirements of the relevant system concerned. An application by any such person to be
registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the
deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and the Directors shall treat it as such.

incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself,
request in writing that some person to be named. by him be registered as the transferee of
such Share or Shares and such request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for
this purpose the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director.

not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director of the company (the “appointing director’) may appoint any other director or any
other eligible person as their alternate to exercise the appointing director’s powers and carry
out the appointing director's responsibilities in relation to the taking of decisions by the
directors in the absence of the appointing director.

power to appoint a further alternate, whether of the appointing director or of the alternate
director, and the alternate does not act as an agent of or for the appointing director.

matters as are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the
Shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign
a note or memorandum of all. matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or
memorandum constitutes sufficient.evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board
is not present, the directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the
meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may
also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors
consented to in writing by all directors or by all members of the committee, as the case may
be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts each
counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on
the date upon which the last director has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the

the person had no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

14.3 For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 14.2, a director acts in the best interests of the Company

entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not
act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the
person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a director in defending any legal, administrative or

acquisitions or disposals effected by the agent which will or may give rise to any obligation of
disclosure imposed by this Regulation with respect to his interest in the Shares.

be interested in the Shares registered in the name of any Shareholder has not within the
requisite period made, or as the case may be, procured the making of any notification

to a person who is or was interested in Shares already issued; and references in Regulations
24.14 to 24.16 above to an interest in Shares are to be read accordingly in any such case as
including respectively any such right and Shares.

If a Disclosure Notice is given to a person appearing to be interested in any Shares, a copy
will at the same time be given to the holder of those Shares, but the accidental omission to do
so or the non-receipt by the Shareholder will not prejudice the operation of Regulations 24.16
to 24.20, which are without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation 24.23.

Subject to the provisions of Regulation 24.20, where a Disclosure Notice is served by the
Company on a person appearing to the Directors to be, or to have been, interested in the
Shares of the Company and that person fails to give the Company any information required by
the Disclosure Notice within the specified time, the Company may (at the discretion of the
Directors) apply to Court for an order directing that the Shares in question be subject to such
restrictions as the Court believes appropriate in the circumstances and/ or deliver a notice on
the Shareholder holding the Shares in relation to which the default has occurred (a “Default
Notice”). The Default Notice shall apply to the Shares in relation to which the default has
occurred and any further Shares which are acquired by the defaulting person (together, the
“Default Shares’).

With effect from delivery of a Default Notice, unless the Directors otherwise determine, a
Shareholder will not be entitled.in respect of any Shares held by him, whether or not referred
to in the Disclosure Notice:

(a) to attend and vote (including by poll) at any meeting whether personally or by proxy;
(b) to receive any dividend or other amount payable in respect of the Shares; or
(c) subject to Regulation 24.22, to transfer or agree to transfer any of the Shares, or any

rights in them-

and the restrictions imposed by these Regulations in relation to any Shares will continue until
a relevant event occurs in relation to those Shares.

Any dividends or other amounts withheld pursuant to Regulation 24.20(b) will be paid (without
interest) to the Shareholder assoon as practicable after the restrictions contained in
Regulation 24.20 cease to have effect.

The restrictions in Regulation 24.20 are without prejudice to the right of either the registered
or the beneficial owner of the Shares concerned, to sell or agree to sell them pursuant to an
arm’s length transfer.

Where a Disclosure Notice is served on a Depositary, and the Depositary fails, through no
fault of its own, for any reason to comply with the Disclosure Notice:

(a) the provisions of Regulations 24.18 to 24.22 will only be implemented by the
Company in relation to those Shares in respect of which there has been a failure, and
will not be implemented in relation to any other Shares in the Company held by the
Depositary; and

(b) the Company will not prevent the Shares held by the Depositary in respect of which
there has been a failure from being transferred by the Depositary to a person shown
to the satisfaction of the Board to be the beneficial holder or holders of such Shares.

The Company may at the absolute discretion of the Directors, at any time give notice to the
Shareholder cancelling, or suspending for a stated period the operation of a Default Notice in
whole or in part.

cheques, warrants, notices of meetings or copies of the documents referred to in these

other person entitled to such Share for the net proceeds of such sale and shall be deemed to
be his debtor and not a trustee for him in respect of the same. Any money not accounted for
to the Shareholder or other person entitled to such Share shall be carried to a separate
account and shall be a permanent debt of the Company. Money carried to such separate
account may either be employed in the business of the Company or invested in such
investments (other than Shares or its holding company, if any) as the Directors may from
