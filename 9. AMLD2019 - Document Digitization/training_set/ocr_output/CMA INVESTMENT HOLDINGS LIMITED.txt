the Company. In these Articles, words.and expressions defined in the Act shall have the
same meaning and, unless. otherwise required by the context, the singular shall include

SHARES

Every person whose name is entered as a member in the share register, being the holder
of registered shares, shall without payment, be entitled to a certificate signed by a director
or under the common seal of the Company with or without the signature of any director
or officer of the Company specifying the share or shares held and the par value thereof,
provided that in respect of shares held jointly by several persons, the Company shall not
be bound to issue more than one certificate and delivery of a certificate for a share to one
of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all.

If a certificate is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out
certificate, or on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as the
directors may reasonably require. Any member receiving a share certificate shall
indemnify and hold the Company and its officers harmless from any loss or liability
which it or they may incur by reason of wrongful or fraudulent use or representation
made by any person by virtue of the possession of such a certificate.

SHARES AND VARIATION OF RIGHTS

forming part of the original or any increased authorised shares) shall be at the disposal of
the directors who may offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to
10

11

12

such persons at such times and for such consideration, being not less than the par value of
the shares being disposed of, and upon such terms and conditions as the directors may
determine.

Without prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any
existing shares or class of shares, any share in the Company may be issued with such
preferred, deferred or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to
dividend, voting or otherwise as the directors may from time to time determine.

Subject to the provisions of the Act in this regard, shares may be issued on the terms that
they are redeemable, or at the option of the Company be liable to be redeemed on such
terms and in such manner as the directors before or at the time of the issue of such shares
may determine.

The directors may redeem any share issued by the Company at a premium.

If at any time the Company is authorised to issue:shares of more than one class the rights
attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that
class) may, whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied with the consent in
writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the issued shares of that class and
the holders of not less than three-fourths of the.issued shares of any other class of shares
which may be affected by such variation.

other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the
shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares
ranking pari passu therewith.

Except as required by the Act, no person.shall be recognised by the Company as holding
any share upon any trust, and the Company shall not be bound by or be compelled in any
way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or
partial interest in any share or any interest in any fractional part of a share or (except as
provided by these Articles or by the Act) any other rights in respect of any share except
any absolute right to the entirety thereof by the registered holder.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Shares in the Company shall be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by
the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee. The instrument of
transfer shall also be signed by the transferee if registration as a holder of the shares
imposes a liability to the Company on the transferee. The instrument of transfer of a
registered share shall be sent to the Company for registration.

Subject to the Memorandum of Association, these Articles and to Section 54(5) of the
Act, the Company shall, on receipt of an instrument of transfer, enter the name of the
13

14

transferee of the share in the register of members unless the directors resolve to refuse or
delay the registration of the transfer for reasons that shall be specified in the resolution.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

Subject to Sections 52(2) and 53 of the Act, the executor or administrator of a deceased
member, the guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member
shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to his share, save
that and only in the event of death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member or
members of the Company as a consequence of which the Company no longer has any
directors or members, then upon the production of any documentation which is
reasonable evidence of the applicant being entitled to:

(a) a grant of probate of the deceased's will, or grant of letters of administration of the
deceased's estate, or confirmation of the appointment as executor or administrator
(as the case may be), of a deceased member's estate; or

(b) the appointment of a guardian of an incompetent member; or
(c) the appointment as trustee of a bankrupt member; or

(d) upon production of any other reasonable evidence of the applicant's beneficial
ownership of, or entitlement to the shares,

to the Company's registered agent in the British Virgin Islands together with (if so
requested by the registered agent) a notarised copy of the share certificate(s) of the
deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member, an indemnity in favour of the registered
agent and appropriate legal advice in respect of any document issued by a foreign court,
then the administrator, executor, guardian_or-trustee in bankruptcy (as the case may be)
notwithstanding that their name has not been entered in the share register of the
Company, may by written resolution of the applicant, endorsed with written approval by
the registered agent, be appointed a director of the Company or entered in the share
register as the legal and or beneficial owner of the shares.

The production to the Company of any document which is reasonable evidence of:

(a) a grant of probate of the will, or grant of letters of administration of the estate, or
confirmation of the appointment as executor, of a deceased member; or

(b) the appointment of a guardian of an incompetent member; or
(c) the trustee of a bankrupt member; or

(d) the applicant's legal and or beneficial ownership of the shares,
15

16

17

18

19

20

21

shall be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent member or bankrupt
member is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document is issued by a
foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purposes of
establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the
directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The directors may also require an
indemnity to be given by the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a share or shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may be registered
as a member upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the
directors. An application by any such person to be registered as a member shall for all
purposes be deemed to be a transfer of shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt
member and the directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of the death,
incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may, instead of being registered himself,
request in writing that some person to be named by, him be registered as the transferee of
such share or shares and such request'shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person ’is‘a matter to be determined by the
court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

ACQUISITION OF OWN SHARES

Subject to the provisions of the Act in this regard, the directors may, on behalf of the
Company purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company's own shares for
such consideration as they consider fit, and either cancel or hold such shares as treasury
shares. The directors may dispose of any shares,held as treasury shares on such terms
and conditions as they may from time to time determine. Shares may be purchased or
otherwise acquired in exchange for newly issued shares in the Company.

in such manner and places as the directors consider necessary or desirable, and they shall
convene such a meeting upon the written request of members entitled to exercise at least
thirty (30) percent of the voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is
requested.

Seven (7) days notice at the least specifying the place, the day and the hour of the
meeting and general nature of the business to be conducted shall be given in the manner
hereinafter mentioned to such persons whose names on the date the notice is given appear
as members in the share register of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting.

requirement to give notice is valid if members holding a ninety (90) percent majority of:
22

23

24

25

26

27

(a) the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting; or

(b) the votes of each class or series of shares where members are entitled to vote
thereon as a class or series together with an absolute majority of the remaining
votes,

have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a member at the
meeting shall be deemed to constitute waiver on his part.

The inadvertent failure of the directors to give notice of a meeting to a member or the fact
that a member has not received the notice, shall not invalidate the meeting.

PROCEEDINGS AT MEETINGS OF MEMBERS

No business shall be transacted at any meeting unless a quorum of members is present at
the time when the meeting proceeds to business. A quorum shall consist of the holder or
holders present in person or by proxy entitled to:exercise at least fifty (50) percent of the
voting rights of the shares of each class.or series of shares entitled to vote as a class or

vote thereon.

the meeting shall be dissolved.

chairman (the "Chairman"). If the members are unable to choose a Chairman for any
reason, then the person representing the greatest number of voting shares present at the
meeting shall preside as Chairman failing which the oldest individual member present at
the meeting or failing any member*personally-attending the meeting, the proxy present at
the meeting representing the oldest member of the Company, shall take the chair.

The Chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to
time, and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned
meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the
adjournment took place.

At any meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of
hands by a simple majority unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of
the show of hands) demanded:

(a) by the Chairman; or
(b) by any member present in person or by proxy and holding not less than one tenth

of the total voting shares issued by the Company and having the right to vote at
the meeting.

38

Unless a poll be so demanded, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has, on a
show of hands been carried, and an entry to that effect in the book containing the minutes
of the proceedings of the Company, shall be sufficient evidence of the fact, without proof
of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.

If a poll is duly demanded it shall be taken in such manner as the Chairman directs, and
the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll
was demanded. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn.

In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands, or on a poll, the
Chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place, or at which the poll is
demanded, shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.

communication, without the need for any_notice.

If a committee is appointed for any member who is of unsound mind, that member may
vote by such committee.

If two or more persons are jointly entitled to a registered share or shares and if more than
one of such persons shall vote in»person or.by proxy at any meeting of members or in
accordance with the terms of Article 31, the vote of that person whose name appears first
among such voting joint holders in the share register shall alone be counted.

Votes may be given either personally or by proxy.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place appointed for the
meeting before the time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such
instrument proposes to vote.

Subject to Article 38 below, an instrument appointing a proxy shall be in such form as the
Chairman of the meeting shall accept as properly evidencing the wishes of the member
appointing the proxy.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointer
unless the appointer is a corporation or other form of legal entity other than one or more
individuals holding as joint owner in which case the instrument appointing a proxy shall

remuneration payable to the director appointing him, and shall consist of such portion of
the last mentioned remuneration as shall be agreed between such alternate and the
director appointing him. A director by writing under his hand deposited at the registered

by him. If a director shall die or cease to hold the office of director, the appointment of
his alternate shall thereupon cease and terminate.

thereof in favour of any resolutions appointing them, or of their number, directors
or officers of such other company, or voting or providing for the payment of
