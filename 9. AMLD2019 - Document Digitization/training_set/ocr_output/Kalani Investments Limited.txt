fraudulent use or representation. made by any person. by virtue of the possession thereof. If a
certificate for Shares is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate
or on satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as may be required by a Resolution of
Directors.

If several Eligible Persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, any one of such Eligible Persons
may give an effectual receipt for any Distribution.

SHARES

Shares and other Securities may be issued at such times, to such Eligible Persons, for such
consideration and on such terms as the directors may by Resolution of Directors determine.

Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note, or other
written obligation to contribute money or property, real property, personal property (including
goodwill and knowhow), services rendered or a contract for future services.

No Shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of Directors has

(b) their determination of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money consideration for
the issue; and

otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.

Directors authorising the purchase, redemption or other acquisition contains a statement that the
directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the acquisition the value of the

due.

(Shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of company) of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

Treasury Shares provided that the number of Shares purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired and
held as Treasury Shares, when aggregated with shares of the same class already held by the company

excluding Shares that have been cancelled. Shares which have been cancelled shall be available for
reissue.

Directors determine.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

the name and address of the transferee, which shall be sent to the Company at the office of its
registered agent for registration.

The transfer of a Share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of
members.

If the directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has been
signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of

Directors:
(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and
(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the

absence of the instrument of transfer.

Share even though the personal representative is not.a Shareholder at the time of the transfer.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Any director of the Company may. convene meetings.of the Shareholders at such times and in such
manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands-as the director considers necessary or
desirable.

in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting of
Shareholders.

The director convening a meeting shall give not less than 7 days’ notice of a meeting of Shareholders
to:

(a) those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the
register of members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and

(b) the other directors.

Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such
other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90 per cent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered
at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder
at the meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure of a director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a
Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not received
notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible
evidence of its contents. Until a Resolution of Directors determining otherwise is passed, the
magnetic, electronic or other data storage shall be the original register of directors.

The directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, fix the emoluments of directors with respect to
services to be rendered in any capacity to the Company.

Each director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company
acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each director, in
exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the director
believes to be the best interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company may,
when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, act in a manner which he believes is in the
best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised
representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the directors, with respect to the
signing of consents or otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of
the Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange.and other negotiable instruments and all
receipts for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise
executed, as the case may be, in-such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution
of Directors.

For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the directors may by Resolution of
Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition is in the usual or
regular course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of

fraud, conclusive.
PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to
each other director.

The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner
and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary
or desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or other
electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of
directors held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors
entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose
the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure
to give notice of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does
not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and the
alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed him and to
vote or consent in place of the director until the appointment lapses or is terminated.

appointment and termination must be given by the appointing director to the Company as soon as
reasonably practicable.

meeting and any written resolution circulated for written consent. An alternate director has no power
to appoint a further alternate, whether of the appointing director or of the alternate director, and the
alternate does not act as an agent of or for the appointing director.

The appointing director may, at any time, voluntarily terminate the alternate director’s appointment.
The voluntary termination of the appointment of an alternate shall take effect from the time when
written notice of the termination is given to the Company. The rights of an alternate shall
automatically terminate if the appointing director dies or otherwise ceases to hold office.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting
there are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of directors,
unless there are only 2 directors in which case the quorum is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of directors do not
apply and such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are
not by the Act, the Memorandum or-the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu
of minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient
evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the Chairman.of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of
the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the
directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be
taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution-of a committee of directors consented to in writing
by a majority of directors or by a majority of the members of the committee, as the case may be,
without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart
being signed by one or more directors. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the
counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last
director has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, may appoint a sub-committee and delegate powers
exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of directors
so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors establishing the
committee.

Where the directors delegate their powers :to'a’committee of directors they remain responsible for the
exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times

duties imposed on directors of the Company under the Act.

is a member, director or officer of another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with respect to
the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction which may, after
the date of the entry or disclosure, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient

Company may:

view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no
reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a
view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the
Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of
a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in
good faith and with a view to the bestinterests of the Company or that the person had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct.was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees,-incurred by a director in. defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of.an undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the amount if it

accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former director to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the former director is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Company in accordance with Sub-Regulation 14.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any,
as the Company deems appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section is
not exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any agreement, Resolution of Shareholders, resolution of
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to acting in the person’s official capacity and as to acting
in another capacity while serving as a director of the Company.
