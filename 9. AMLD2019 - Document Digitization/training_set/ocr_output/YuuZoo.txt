APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Subject to the Act, no Shares may be issued by the Board without the prior approval of an Ordinary
Resolution in general meeting but subject thereto and to these Articles and without prejudice to any
special rights or restrictions for the time being attached to any Shares or any class of Shares, the
unissued Shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may offer, allot, grant
options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such times and for such consideration
and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may in its absolute discretion determine, provided
always that:

(a) no Shares shall be issued to transfer a controlling interest in the Company without the prior
approval of an Ordinary Resolution in general meeting;

(b) (Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by Ordinary Resolution in general
meeting) any issue of Shares for cash to Shareholders holding Shares of any class shall be
offered to such Shareholders in proportion as nearly as may be to the number of Shares of
such class then held by them and the provisions of the second sentence of Regulation 2.6
with such adaptations as are necessary shall apply; and

(c) any other issue of Shares, the aggregate of which would exceed the limits referred to in
Regulation 2.7 shall be subject to approval by Ordinary Resolution in general meeting.

Neither the Company nor the Board shall be obliged, when making or granting any allotment of,
offer of, option over or disposal of Shares, to make, or make available, any such allotment, offer,
option or Shares to Shareholders or others with registered addresses in any particular territory or
territories being a territory or territories where, in the absence of a registration statement or other
special formalities, this would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable.
Shareholders affected as a result of the foregoing sentence shall not be, or be deemed to be, a
separate class of Shareholders for any purpose whatsoever.

Except as permitted under the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange or any direction
given by Ordinary Resolution in general meeting, all new Shares shall before issue be offered to such
persons who as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the Company of general
meetings in proportion, as far as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing Shares to
which they are entitled. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of Shares offered,
and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined. After
the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is
made that he declines to accept the Shares offered, the Board may dispose of those Shares in such
manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. The Board may likewise so dispose of any
new Shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new Shares bear to Shares held by persons
entitled to an offer of new Shares) cannot, in the opinion of the Board, be conveniently offered under
this Regulation 2.6.

Notwithstanding Regulation 2.6 above but subject to the Statutes, the Company in general meeting
may by Ordinary Resolution grant to the Directors a general authority, either unconditionally or subject
to such conditions as may be specified in the said Ordinary Resolution, for further issues of Shares
where the aggregate number of Shares to be issued pursuant to such authority does not exceed fifty
percent (50%) (or such other limit, if any, as may be prescribed by the Designated Stock Exchange)
of the issued Shares of the Company at the time of the passing of the said Ordinary Resolution, of
which the aggregate number of Shares to be issued other than on a pro rata basis to Shareholders
does not exceed twenty percent (20%) (or such other limit, if any, as may be prescribed by the
Designated Stock Exchange) of the issued Shares of the Company at the time of the passing of the
said Ordinary Resolution. Provided that such general authority shall only remain in force until:

(a) — the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company following the passing of the
resolution granting the said authority; or

(b) the date by which such annual general meeting is required to be held; or
(c) it is revoked or varied by Ordinary Resolution in general meeting,

whichever is the earliest.

THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form or a combination of forms, including money, a
promissory note, or other written obligation to contribute money or property, real property, personal
property (including goodwill and know-how), services rendered or a contract for future services.

Before issuing Shares for a consideration which is, in whole or in part, other than money, a Resolution
of Directors shall be passed stating:

(a) | the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares; and

(6b) — that, in the opinion of the Directors, the present cash value of the non-money consideration
and money consideration, if any, is not less than the amount to be credited for the issue of the
Shares.

The Board may issue warrants conferring the right upon the holders thereof to subscribe for any
class of Shares or securities in the Company on such terms as it may from time to time determine,
provided that such issue must be specifically approved by Ordinary Resolution in general meeting if
required by the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange.

The Company may in connection with the issue of any Shares exercise all powers of paying
commission and brokerage conferred or permitted by the Act. Subject to the Act, the commission
may be satisfied by the payment of cash or by the allotment of fully or partly paid Shares or partly in
one and partly in the other.

Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding any Share
upon any trust and the Company shall not be bound by or required in any way to recognise (even
when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share or any
fractional part of a Share or (except only as otherwise provided by these Articles or by law) any other
rights in respect of any Share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.

Subject to the terms and conditions of any application for Shares and any applicable rules of the
Designated Stock Exchange, the Board shall allot Shares applied for within ten (10) market days of
the closing date of any such application (or such other period as may be approved by the Designated
Stock Exchange).

Subject to the Act and these Articles, the Board may at any time after the allotment of Shares
but before any person has been entered in the Register of Members as the holder, recognise a
renunciation thereof by the allottee in favour of some other person and may accord to any allottee
of a Share a right to effect such renunciation upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the
Board considers fit to impose.

The Company may divide its Shares, including issued Shares, into a larger number of Shares or
combine its Shares, including issued Shares, into a smaller number of Shares in accordance with
section 40A of the Act.

If at any time the Shares are divided into different classes, the rights attached to any class (unless
otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may only be varied or abrogated,
whether or not the Company is in liquidation, with the approval of a 75% Resolution of Shareholders
of that class present in person or by proxy and voting at a separate meeting of the holders of the
Shares of that class, provided always that where the necessary majority for such a resolution is not
obtained at the meeting, consent in writing if obtained from the holders of 75% of the Shares of that
class within two months of the meeting, shall be as valid and effectual as a resolution carried at the
meeting.

The rights conferred upon the holders of any Shares or class of Shares shall not, unless otherwise
expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such Shares, be deemed to be
varied, modified or abrogated by the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith.

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall give, whether directly or indirectly, whether by
means of loan, guarantee, provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose
of the acquisition or proposed acquisition by any person of any Shares.

determine. No certificate shall be issued representing Shares of more than one class. The Board
may by resolution determine, either generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures
on any such certificates (or certificates in respect of other securities) need not be autographic but
may be affixed to such certificates by some mechanical means or may be printed thereon or that
such certificates need not be signed by any person.

Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, if any share certificate shall be defaced, worn out, destroyed,
lost or stolen, it may be renewed on such evidence being produced and a letter of indemnity (if
required) being given by the Shareholder, transferee, person entitled, purchaser, member firm or
member company of the Designated Stock Exchange or on behalf of its or their client or clients
as the Directors shall require, and (in case of defacement or wearing out) on delivery of the old
certificate for cancellation and in any case on payment of such sum not exceeding two Singapore
dollars (S$2.00) as the Directors may from time to time require together with the amount of the stamp
duty payable (if any) on each share certificate. In the case of destruction, loss or theft, a Shareholder
or person entitled to whom such renewed certificate is given shall also bear the loss and pay to the
Company all expenses incidental to the investigations by the Company of the evidence of such
destruction or loss.

In the case of a Share held jointly by several persons:

(a) | the Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate therefor and delivery of a
certificate to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders;

(b) any request relating to cancellation or issue of share certificates may be made by any one of
the registered joint holders; and

(c) any one of such persons may give an effectual receipt for any distribution.

Every person whose name is entered as a Shareholder in the Register of Members shall be entitled
to receive one certificate for all Shares of any one class or several certificates each for one or more of
such Shares of such class upon payment for every certificate after the first of such fee as is provided
in Regulation 3.5.

The fee payable in respect of share certificates referred to in this Regulation and Regulation 3.7 shall
be an amount not exceeding two Singapore dollars (S$2.00) per certificate or such other maximum
amount as the Designated Stock Exchange may from time to time determine provided that the
Board may at any time waive such fee or determine a lower amount for such fee.

Upon every transfer of Shares the certificate held by the transferor shall be given up to be cancelled,
and shall forthwith be cancelled accordingly, and a new certificate shall be issued to the transferee
in respect of the Shares transferred to him.

Where a Shareholder transfers part only of the Shares comprised in a certificate or where a
Shareholder requires the Company to cancel any certificate or certificates and issue new certificates
for the purpose of subdividing his holding in a different manner the old certificate or certificates
shall be cancelled and a new certificate or certificates for the balance of such Shares issued in lieu
thereof and such Shareholder shall pay all or any part of the stamp duty payable (if any) on each
share certificate prior to the delivery thereof which the Board in its absolute discretion may require
and such fee as is provided in Regulation 3.5.

Subject to the payment of all or any part of the stamp duty payable (if any) on each share certificate
prior to the delivery thereof which the Board in its absolute discretion may require, every person
whose name is entered as a Shareholder in the Register of Members shall be entitled to receive
within ten (10) market days of the date of allotment (or such other period as may be approved by
the Designated Stock Exchange) or within ten (10) market days after the date of lodgement of a
registrable transfer (or such other period as may be approved by the Designated Stock Exchange)
share certificates in reasonable denominations for the Shares so allotted or transferred.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Nothing in these Articles shall require title to any Shares or other securities of the Company to be
evidenced by a certificate if the Act and the rules and regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange
permit Shares to be recorded in uncertificated book entry form.

LIEN

The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on all the Shares not fully paid up registered in
the name of a Shareholder (whether solely or jointly with others). Such lien shall be restricted to
unpaid calls and instalments upon the specific Shares in respect of which such moneys are due and
unpaid, and to such amounts as the Company may be called upon by law to pay in respect of the
Shares of the Shareholder or deceased Shareholder. The Company’s lien on a Share shall extend
to all dividends or other moneys payable thereon or in respect thereof. The Board may at any time,
generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or declare any Share exempt in
whole or in part, from the provisions of this Regulation.

Where the Company has a lien on any Share not fully paid up, all persons taking any subsequent
security thereon shall take the same subject to such prior security, and shall not be entitled, by
notice to the Shareholders or otherwise, to obtain priority over such prior security.

CALLS ON SHARES

Subject to these Articles and to the terms of allotment, the Board may from time to time make calls
upon the Shareholders in respect of any moneys unpaid on their Shares, and each Shareholder
shall (subject to being given at least fourteen (14) clear days’ Notice specifying the time and place
of payment) pay to the Company as required by such notice the amount called on his Shares. A
call may be extended, postponed or revoked in whole or in part as the Board determines but no
Shareholder shall be entitled to any such extension, postponement or revocation except as a matter
of grace and favour.

A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the Resolution of Directors authorising
the call was passed and may be made payable either in one lump sum or by instalments.

A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding
the subsequent transfer of the Shares in respect of which the call was made. The joint holders of
a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and instalments due in respect thereof or
other moneys due in respect thereof.

No Shareholder shall be entitled to receive any dividend or bonus or to be present and vote (Save as
proxy for another Shareholder) at any general meeting either personally or by proxy, or be reckoned
in a quorum, or exercise any other privilege as a Shareholder until all calls or instalments due by him
to the Company, whether alone or jointly with any other person, together with interest and expenses
(if any) shall have been paid.

Any amount payable in respect of a Share upon allotment or at any fixed date, shall be deemed to
be a call duly made and payable on the date fixed for payment and if it is not paid the provisions of
these Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made
and notified.

On the issue of Shares the Board may differentiate between the allottees or holders as to the amount
of calls to be paid and the times of payment.

The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any Shareholder willing to advance the same, and either
in money or money’s worth, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid or instalments payable
upon any Shares held by him and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced (until the same would,
but for such advance, become presently payable) as the Board may decide. The Board may at any
time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such Shareholder not less than one month’s
Notice of its intention in that behalf, unless before the expiration of such notice the amount so
advanced shall have been called up on the Shares in respect of which it was advanced. Such
payment in advance shall not entitle the holder of such Share or Shares to participate in respect
thereof in a dividend subsequently declared or in profits.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

FORFEITURE

Shares that are not fully paid on issue are subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in this
Regulation and for this purpose Shares issued for a promissory note, other written obligation to
contribute money or property or a contract for future services are deemed to be not fully paid.

Awritten Notice of call specifying the date for payment to be made shall be served on the Shareholder
who defaults in making payment in respect of the Shares.

The written Notice of call referred to in Regulation 6.2 shall name a further date not earlier than the
expiration of fourteen (14) clear days’ from the date of service of the Notice on or before which the
payment required by the notice is to be made:

(a) requiring payment of the amount unpaid; and

(b) — stating that in the event of non-payment at or before the time named in the Notice, the Shares,
or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be liable to be forfeited.

If the requirements of any such Notice are not complied with, any Share in respect of which such
Notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before tender of payment of all calls due in respect
thereof has been made, be forfeited and cancelled by a Resolution of Directors to that effect, and
such forfeiture shall include all dividends and bonuses declared in respect of the forfeited Share but
not actually paid before the forfeiture.

When any Share has been forfeited, Notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon the person who was
before forfeiture the holder of the Share, and an entry of the forfeiture, with the date thereof, shall
forthwith be made in the Register of Members, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated
by any omission or neglect to give such Notice or make any such entry.

The Board may accept the surrender of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case,
references in these Articles to forfeiture will include surrender.

A person whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Shareholder in respect of the forfeited
Shares. For the purposes of this Regulation any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, is
payable thereon at a fixed time which is subsequent to the date of forfeiture, shall notwithstanding
that time has not yet arrived be deemed to be payable at the date of forfeiture, and the same shall
become due and payable immediately upon the forfeiture.

A declaration by a Director or the Secretary that a Share has been forfeited on a specified date shall
be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to
the Share.

The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to the Shareholder whose Shares have
been forfeited pursuant to this Regulation 6 and that Shareholder shall be discharged from any
further obligation to the Company.

REGISTER OF MEMBERS

The Company shall keep a Register of Members containing:

a) | the names and addresses of the persons who hold Shares;

b) the number of each class and series of Shares held by each Shareholder;

c) the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the Register of Members; and

—a~ arr ON—O ~~

d) — the date on which any person ceased to be a Shareholder.

The Register of Members may be in any such form as the Board may approve, but if it is in magnetic,
electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its
contents. Until the Board otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form
shall be the original Register of Members.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Subject to the Act, the Company may keep an overseas or local or other branch register of members
resident in any place, and the Board may make and vary such regulations as it determines in respect
of the keeping of any such register and maintaining a Registration Office in connection therewith.

The Register of Members and branch register of members, as the case may be, shall be open to
inspection between 10.00 a.m. and 12.00 noon on every business day by Shareholders without
charge or by any other person, if appropriate, upon a maximum payment of ten Singapore dollars
(S$10.00) at the Registration Office or at the office of a share transfer agent of the Company. The
Register of Members including any overseas or local or other branch register of members may, after
notice has been given by advertisement in an appointed newspaper and in accordance with the
requirements of the Designated Stock Exchange or by any electronic means as may be accepted by
the Designated Stock Exchange, be closed at such times or for such periods not exceeding in tbe
whole thirty (80) days in each year as the Board may determine and either generally or in respect of
any class of Shares.

A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the Register of
Members.

Subject to the Act and the rules and regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange, the Board
without further consultation with the holders of any Shares or securities of the Company:

(a) may resolve that any class or series of Shares or other securities of the Company from time
to time in issue or to be issued (including Shares in issue at the date of the adoption of these
Articles) may be issued, held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise dealt with in
uncertificated form in accordance with the Securities Regulations and practices instituted
by the Depository and no provision of these Articles will apply to any uncertificated Share
or other securities in uncertificated form to the extent that they are inconsistent with the
holding of such Shares or other securities in uncertificated form in the relevant system of the
Depository or the transfer of title to any such Shares or other securities by means of a relevant
system of the Depository or any provision of the Securities Regulations; and

(b) have power to implement and/or approve any arrangements they may, in their absolute
discretion, think fit in relation to (without limitation) the evidencing of title to and transfer
of interest in Shares in the Company in the form of depository interests or similar interests,
instruments or securities, and to the extent such arrangements are so implemented, no
provision of these Articles shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect
inconsistent with the holding or transfer of interest in Shares in the Company in the form of
depository interests or similar interests, instruments or securities. The Board may from time
to time take such action and do such things as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit
in relation to the operation of any such arrangements.

Conversion of Shares held in certificated form into Shares held in uncertificated form, and vice
versa, may be made in such manner as the Board may, in its absolute discretion, think fit (Subject
always to the Securities Regulations and the requirements of the relevant system concerned). The
Company shall enter on the Register of Members the number of Shares held by each Shareholder in
uncertificated from and in certificated form and shall maintain the Register of Members in each case
as is required by the Securities Regulations and the relevant system concerned. Notwithstanding
any provision of these Articles, a class or series of Shares shall not be treated as two (2) classes by
virtue only of that class or series comprising both certificated Shares and uncertificated Shares or as
a result of any provision of these Articles or the Securities Regulations which apply only in respect
of the certificated or uncertificated Shares.

REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES

Subject to Regulation 8.3, the Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its
own Shares on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Board thinks fit, provided that
the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent
of Shareholders whose Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the
Company is permitted by the Act or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase,

redeem or otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent. For so long as the Shares of the
Company are listed on the Designated Stock Exchange, the prior approval of Shareholders by
Ordinary Resolution in general meeting for such purchase or acquisition (such approval to state
the Shares which may in aggregate be purchased or acquired during any one financial year of the
Company). Such approval of the Shareholders shall remain in force until:

(a) | the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company following the passing of the
resolution granting the said authority; or

(b) the date by which such annual general meeting is required to be held; or
(c) it is revoked or varied by Ordinary Resolution in general meeting,

whichever is the earliest, and may thereafter be renewed by the Shareholders in general meeting. For
so long as the Shares of the Company are listed on the Designated Stock Exchange, the Company
shall make an announcement to the Designated Stock Exchange of any purchase or acquisition by
the Company of its own shares on the market day following the day of such purchase or acquisition.

Subject to Regulation 8.1, the Company may acquire its own fully paid Shares for no consideration
by way of surrender of the Shares to the Company by the person holding the Shares. Any such
surrender shall be in writing and signed by the person holding the Shares.

The Company may only offer to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire Shares if the Resolution of
Directors authorising the purchase, redemption or other acquisition contains a statement that the
Directors are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the purchase, redemption or
other acquisition the value of the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will
be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires may be cancelled or held as
treasury shares provided that the number of Shares purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired
and held as treasury shares, when aggregated with Shares of the same class already held by the
Company as treasury shares, may not exceed 50% of the Shares of that class previously issued
by the Company excluding Shares that have been cancelled. Shares which have been cancelled
shall be available for reissue subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules or regulations of the
Designated Stock Exchange.

All rights and obligations attaching to a treasury share are suspended and shall not be exercised by
the Company while it holds the Share as a treasury share.

Treasury shares may be transferred by the Company and the provisions of the Act, the Memorandum
and these Articles that apply to the issue of Shares shall apply to the transfer of treasury shares.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF SHARES

Shareholders may mortgage or charge their Shares.

There shall be entered in the Register of Members at the written request of the Shareholder:
(a) a statement that the Shares held by him are mortgaged or charged;

(b) | the name of the mortgagee or chargee; and

(c) | the date on which the particulars specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) are entered in the
Register of Members.

Where particulars of a mortgage or charge are entered in the Register of Members, such particulars
may be cancelled:

(a) — with the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorised to act on
his behalf; or

(b) upon evidence satisfactory to the Directors of the discharge of the liability secured by the
mortgage or charge and the issue of such indemnities as the Board shall consider necessary
or desirable.

Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge over Shares are entered in the Register of Members
pursuant to this Regulation:

(a) no transfer of any Share the subject of those particulars shall be effected;

(6) | the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such Share; and
(c) no replacement certificate shall be issued in respect of such Shares,

without the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee.

The Directors may not resolve to refuse or delay the transfer of a Share pursuant to the enforcement
of a valid security interest created over the Share.

The Board shall cause a proper register of registered charges to be kept, in accordance with the
provisions of the Act, of all charges specifically affecting the property of the Company and shall duly
comply with the requirements of the Act in regard to the registration of charges therein specified and
otherwise.

RECORD DATES
The Company or the Directors may fix any date as the record date for:

(a) | determining the Shareholders entitled to receive any dividend, distribution, allotment or issue
and such record date may be on, or at any time not more than thirty (80) days before or after,
any date on which such dividend, distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or made;
and

(b) determining the Shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at any meeting of the
Company in accordance with Regulation 14.4.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Subject to any limitations in these Articles, certificated Shares and other uncertificated Shares which
are not held within a relevant system may be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed
by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee, which shall be sent to
the Company for registration, provided always that the Company shall accept for registration an
instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Designated Stock Exchange.

In the case of uncertificated Shares and other uncertificated securities issued by the Company and
held within a relevant system, subject to the Act and the rules and regulations of the Designated
Stock Exchange, a Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer his Shares or other securities by means
of a relevant system and the operator of the relevant system shall act as agent of the Shareholders
for the purposes of the transfer of Shares or other securities. In addition to the foregoing, a transfer
of uncertificated Shares is effective only if a record of the transfer evidencing the transferor’s consent
is available and the statutory particulars in respect of the transferee are entered in the Register of
Members, provided always that the Company shall accept for registration an instrument of transfer
in a form approved by the Designated Stock Exchange.

The transferor of any Shares shall remain the holder of those Shares until the name of the transferee
is entered in the Register of Members as the holder of those Shares.

The Board in so far as permitted by any applicable law may, in its absolute discretion, at any time
and from time to time transfer any Share upon the Register of Members to any branch register of
members or any Share on any branch register of members to the Register of Members or any other
branch register of members. In the event of any such transfer, the Shareholder requesting such
transfer shall bear the cost of effecting the transfer unless the Board otherwise determines.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Unless the Board otherwise agrees (which agreement may be on such terms and subject to such
conditions as the Board in its absolute discretion may from time to time determine, and which
agreement the Board shall, without giving any reason therefor, be entitled in its absolute discretion
to give or withhold), no Shares upon the Register of Members shall be transferred to any branch
register of members nor shall Shares on any branch register of members be transferred to the
Register of Members or any other branch register of members and all transfers and other documents
of title shall be lodged for registration, and registered, in the case of any Shares on a branch register
of members, at the relevant Registration Office, and, in the case of any Shares on the Register of
Members, at the registered office or such other place at which the Register of Members is kept in
accordance with the Act.

The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason therefor, refuse to register
a transfer of any Share (not being a fully paid up Share) to a person of whom it does not approve,
or any Share issued under any share incentive scheme for employees upon which a restriction on
transfer imposed thereby still subsists, and it may also, without prejudice to the foregoing generality,
refuse to register a transfer of any Share (not being a fully paid up Share) on which the Company has
a lien or, except in the case of a transfer to executors, administrators or trustees of the estate of a
deceased Shareholder, a transfer of any Share to more than three (8) joint holders.

The Board may decline to register a transfer of any Share to a person known to be a minor, bankrupt
or person who is mentally disordered or a patient for the purpose of any British Virgin Islands or
foreign statute relating to mental health.

Save as provided in these Articles, there shall be no restriction on the transfer of fully paid up Shares
(except where required by law or the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange).

Without limiting the generality of Regulation 11.8, the Board may decline to recognise any instrument
of transfer unless:

(a) | afee of such sum (not exceeding two Singapore dollars (S$2.00) or such other maximum sum
as the Designated Stock Exchange may determine to be payable) as the Board may from time
to time require is paid to the Company in respect thereof;

(6b) — the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of Shares;

(c) the instrument of transfer is lodged at the registered office or such other place at which the
Register of Members is kept in accordance with the Act or the Registration Office (as the case
may be) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the
Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if
the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that
person so to do); and

(d) _ if applicable, the instrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped.

11.10 If the Board are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has been signed but that

the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of Directors:
(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in the Register of Members notwithstanding the
absence of the instrument of transfer.

11.11 If the Board refuses to register a transfer of any Share, it shall, within one (1) month after the date on

which the transfer was lodged with the Company or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed
by the Act, send to each of the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal.

11.12 The registration of transfers of Shares or of any class of Shares may, after notice has been given by

advertisement in an appointed newspaper in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the
practice of the Designated Stock Exchange, be suspended at such times and for such periods (not
exceeding in aggregate thirty (30) days in any year) as the Board may determine.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

In the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or survivors where the deceased Shareholder
was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased Shareholder where the
deceased Shareholder was a sole holder, or the guardian of an incompetent Shareholder, or the
trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having
any title to the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt (as the case may be) Shareholder’s interest in the
Shares. Nothing herein shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect
of any Share which had been jointly held by such deceased Shareholder with other persons. Subject
to the provisions of the Act, for the purpose of this Regulation, legal personal representative means
the executor or administrator of a deceased Shareholder or such other person as the Board may, in
its absolute discretion, decide as being properly authorised to deal with the Shares of a deceased
Shareholder. Where two or more persons are registered as joint holders of a Share or Shares, then
in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the remaining joint holder or holders shall be
absolutely entitled to the said Share or Shares and the Company shall recognise no claim in respect
of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of the last survivor of such joint holders.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters
of administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased Shareholder or of the
appointment of a guardian of an incompetent Shareholder or the trustee of a bankrupt Shareholder
shall be accepted by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder
is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document evidencing the grant of probate or
letters of administration, confirmation as executor, appointment as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy
is issued by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of
establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the Board
may obtain appropriate legal advice. The Board may also require an indemnity to be given by the
executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in consequence
of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered as a Shareholder
upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Directors and in the
case of uncertificated Shares subject also to the facilities and requirements of the relevant system
concerned. An application by any such person to be registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes
be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and
the Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death, incompetence
or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself, request in writing that
some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee and he shall execute a transfer
of the Share or Shares in favour of that person, such request shall likewise be treated as if it were
a transfer. If a person elects himself to become the holder, he shall notify the Company in writing
either at the Registration Office or the registered office, as the case may be, to that effect. The
provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer and registration of transfers of Shares shall apply
to such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the Shareholder had not
occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by such Shareholder.

A person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of a
Shareholder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be
entitled if he were the registered holder of the Share. However, the Board may, if it thinks fit, withhold
the payment of any dividend payable or other advantages in respect of such Share until such person
shall become the registered holder of the Share or shall have effectually transferred such Share, but,
subject to the requirements of Regulation 16.11 being met, such a person may vote at meetings.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Subject to the Act, the bye-laws or listing rules of the Designated Stock Exchange or such other
applicable laws, an annual general meeting of the Company shall be held at such time and place as
may be determined by the Board. In addition, for so long as the Shares of the Company are listed on
the Designated Stock Exchange, the interval between the close of the Company’s financial year and
the date of the Company’s annual general meeting shall not exceed four (4) months or such other
period as may be prescribed or permitted by the Designated Stock Exchange.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Each general meeting, other than an annual general meeting, shall be called a special general
meeting. General meetings may be held in any part of the world as may be determined by the Board.

The Board may whenever it thinks fit call special general meetings, and, subject to the Act,
Shareholders entitled at the date of deposit of the requisition to exercise not less than ten percent
(10%) of the voting rights in respect of the matters for which the meeting is requested shall have the
right, by written requisition to the Board or the Secretary of the Company, to require a special general
meeting to be called by the Board for the transaction of any business specified in such requisition;
and such meeting shalt be held within two (2) months after the deposit of such requisition.

In the event that Shares of the Company are divided into different classes of Shares, to any separate
general meeting and all adjournments thereof all the provisions of the Articles relating to general
meetings of the Company and to the proceedings thereat shall mutatis mutandis apply, except that
the necessary quorum (other than at an adjourned meeting) shall be two persons at least holding
or representing by proxy at least thirty three and a third percent (33.33%) of the issued Shares of
the class, and at any adjourned meeting of such holders, two holders present in person or by proxy
(whatever the number of Shares held by them) shall be a quorum and that any holder of Shares of
the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll and that every such holder shall on a poll
have one vote for every Share of the class held by him, provided always that where the necessary
majority for a 75% Resolution of Shareholders is not obtained at such general meeting, consent
in writing if obtained from the holders of seventy five percent (75%) of the issued Shares of the
class concerned within two months of such general meeting shall be as valid and effectual as a
75% Resolution of Shareholders carried at such general meeting. The foregoing provisions of this
Regulation shall apply to the variation or abrogation of the special rights attached to some only of
the Shares of any class as if each group of Shares of the class differently treated formed a separate
class the special rights whereof are to be varied.

NOTICE OF MEETINGS

At least fourteen (14) days’ Notice of a general meeting shall be given to each Shareholder entitled to
attend and vote thereat. A general meeting at which the passing of a 75% Resolution of Shareholders
is to be considered shall be called by not less than twenty-one (21) days’ Notice. A general meeting,
whether or not a 75% Resolution of Shareholders will be considered at such meeting, may be called
by shorter notice if it is so agreed:

(a) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all the Shareholders entitled
to attend and vote thereat; and

For so long as the Shares of the Company are listed on the Designated Stock Exchange, at least
fourteen (14) days’ (or twenty-one (21) days, in the case of a meeting where a 75% Resolution of
Shareholders will be considered) notice of any general meeting shall be given by advertisement
in an English daily newspaper in circulation in Singapore and in writing to the Designated Stock
Exchange.

The period of notice shall be exclusive of the day on which it is served or deemed to be served and
exclusive of the day on which the meeting is to be held, and the Notice shall specify the day, time
and place of the meeting and, in case of special business, the general nature of the business. Any
Notice of a general meeting to consider special business shall be accompanied by a statement
regarding the effect of any proposed resolution on the Company in respect of such special business.

general meeting shall be given to all Shareholders other than to such Shareholders as, under the
provisions of these Articles or the terms of issue of the Shares they hold, are not entitled to receive
such notices from the Company, to all persons entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy or winding-up of a Shareholder and to each of the Directors and the Auditor.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Subject to the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange and any other applicable laws,
the Board convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining those
Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date Notice is given of the meeting, or such
other date as may be specified in the Notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the Notice.

The Secretary may postpone any general meeting called in accordance with the provisions of
these Articles (other than a meeting requisitioned under these Articles) provided that notice of
postponement is given to each Shareholder before the time for such meeting. Fresh notice of the
date, time and place for the postponed meeting shall be given to each Shareholder in accordance
with the provisions of these Articles.

The accidental omission to give Notice of a meeting or (in cases where instruments of proxy are sent
out with the Notice) to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such Notice or such
instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such Notice shall not invalidate any resolution
passed or the proceedings at that meeting.

PROCEEDINGS AT MEETINGS

Shareholders may participate in any general meeting by means of such telephone, electronic or
other communication facilities as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with
each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at a special general meeting, and also all
business that is transacted at an annual general meeting, with the exception of declaring a dividend,
the reading, considering and adopting of the accounts and balance sheet and the reports of the
Directors and Auditor and other documents required to be annexed to the balance sheet, the election
of Directors and appointment of the Auditor and other officers in the place of those retiring, the fixing
of the remuneration of the Auditor, and the voting of remuneration or extra remuneration to the
Directors.

No business, other than the appointment of a chairman of a meeting, shall be transacted at any
general meeting unless a quorum of Shareholders is present at the time when the meeting proceeds
to business. Except as herein otherwise provided, two (2) Shareholders present in person shall form
a quorum, provided that if the Company shall at any time have only one Shareholder, one Shareholder
present in person or by proxy, or being a corporation by its representative duly authorized, shall form
a quorum for the transaction of business at any general meeting of the Company held during such
time. For the purposes of this Regulation, Shareholder includes a person attending as a proxy or as
a duly authorized representative of a corporation which is a Shareholder. Where the Company shall
at any time have only one Shareholder and a quorum comprises a single Shareholder or proxy, such
person may pass any resolution and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such
person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid Ordinary Resolution.

If within thirty (80) minutes (or such longer time not exceeding one hour as the chairman of the
meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present,
the meeting, if convened on the requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved. In any other case it
shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time
and place as the Board may determine. If at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within
half an hour from the time appointed for holding the meeting, the meeting shall be dissolved.

The President of the Company or the chairman shall preside as chairman at every general meeting.
If at any meeting the President or the chairman, as the case may be, is not present within fifteen
(15) minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, or if neither of them is willing to act
as Chairman, the Directors present shall choose one of their number to act, or if one Director only
is present he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no Director is present, or if each of the
Directors present declines to take the chair, or if the chairman chosen shall retire from the chair, the
Shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall elect one of their number to be
chairman.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

The chairman may, with the consent of any meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so
directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place as the
meeting shall determine, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than
the business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting had the adjournment not
taken place. When a meeting is adjourned for less than fourteen (14) days, at least two (2) clear
days’ Notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given, and where a meeting is adjourned for fourteen
(14) days or more, at least seven (7) clear days’ Notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given, in
each case, specifying the time and place of the adjourned meeting but it shall not be necessary to
specify in such notice the nature of the business to be transacted at the adjourned meeting and the
general nature of the business to be transacted.

If an amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled out of
order by the chairman of the meeting, the proceedings on the substantive resolution shall not be
invalidated by any error in such ruling. In the case of a resolution duly proposed as a 75% Resolution
of Shareholders, no amendment thereto (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent
error) may in any event be considered or voted upon.

Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

VOTING

If required by the listing rules of the Designated Stock Exchange, all resolutions at general meetings
shall be voted by poll (unless such requirement is waived by the Designated Stock Exchange).

A holder of a Share shall be entitled to be present and to vote at any general meeting in respect of
any Share or Shares upon which all calls due to the Company have been paid. Subject to Regulation
16.1 and any special rights or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any Shares by
or in accordance with these Articles, at any general meeting:

(a) | onashow of hands every Shareholder present in person (or being a corporation, is present
by a representative duly authorised), or by proxy shall have one vote and the chairman of the
meeting shall determine which proxy shall be entitled to vote where a Shareholder (other than
the Depository) is represented by two proxies; and

(6) ona poll every Shareholder present in person or by proxy or, in the case of a Shareholder
being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative shall have one vote for every fully
paid share of which he is the holder or which he represents and in respect of which all calls
due to the Company have been paid, but so that no amount paid up or credited as paid up
on a Share in advance of calls or instalments is treated for the foregoing purposes as paid up
on the Share. A resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of hands
unless (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands or on the withdrawal of
any other demand for a poll) a poll is demanded:

(i) by the chairman of such meeting; or

(ii) by at least three (3) Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder
being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy for the time being
entitled to vote at the meeting; or

(iii) | by a Shareholder or Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder
being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and representing
not less than ten percent (10%) of the total voting rights of all Shareholders having the
right to vote at the meeting; or

(iv) by a Shareholder or Shareholders present in person (or in the case of a Shareholder
being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and holding
Shares in the Company conferring a right to vote at the meeting being Shares on which
an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than ten percent (10%) of the total
voting rights of all Shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting; or

(v) | where the Depository is a Member, by at least three (8) proxies representing the
Depository.

A demand by a person as proxy for a Shareholder or in the case of a Shareholder being a corporation
by its duly authorised representative shall be deemed to be the same as a demand by a Shareholder.

Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman that
a resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or not carried by a
particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect made in the minute book of the Company, shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded
for or against the resolution.

If a poll is duly demanded the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting
at which the poll was demanded.

A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a question of adjournment, shall be taken
forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner (including the use
of ballot or voting papers or tickets or electronic means) and either forthwith or at such time (being
not later than thirty (80) days after the date of the demand) and place as the chairman directs. It shall
not be necessary (unless the chairman otherwise directs) for notice to be given of a poll not taken
immediately.

The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting or the transaction of any
business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded, and, with the consent of the
chairman, it may be withdrawn at any time before the close of the meeting or the taking of the poll,
whichever is the earlier.

On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.

A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he
uses in the same way.

Where there are joint holders of any Share any one of such joint holder may vote, either in person
or by proxy, in respect of such Share as if he were solely entitled thereto, but if more than one of
such joint holders be present at any meeting the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in
person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and
for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register
of Members in respect of the joint holding. Several executors or administrators of a deceased
Shareholder in whose name any Share stands shall for the purposes of this Regulation be deemed
joint holders thereof.

16.10 A Shareholder who is a patient for any purpose relating to mental health or in respect of whom

16.11

an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction for the protection or management of the
affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs may vote, whether on a show of hands
or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person in the nature of a receiver,
committee or curator bonis appointed by such court, and such receiver, committee, curator bonis
or other person may vote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and be treated as if he were the
registered holder of such Shares for the purposes of general meetings, provided that such evidence
as the Board may require of the authority of the person claiming to vote shall have been deposited at
the registered office, head office or Registration Office, as appropriate, not less than forty eight (48)
hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, or adjourned meeting or poll, as the case
may be.

Any person entitled under Regulation 12.2 to be registered as the holder of any Shares may vote
at any general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were the registered holder of
such Shares, provided that forty eight (48) hours at least before the time of the holding of the meeting
or adjourned meeting, as the case may be, at which he proposes to vote, he shall satisfy the Board
of his entitlement to such Shares, or the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote at
such meeting in respect thereof.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

16.12 No Shareholder shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be entitled to attend and vote and to

be reckoned in a quorum at any general meeting unless he is duly registered and all calls or other
sums presently payable by him in respect of Shares in the Company have been paid.

16.13 If:

17

(a) —_ any objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter; or

(b) any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or which might have
been rejected; or

(c) any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted;

the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned meeting on any
resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or, as the case may be, the
adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs.
Any objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only vitiate the
decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the same may have affected the
decision of the meeting. The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive.

PROXIES

Any Shareholder entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company who is the holder of two (2)
or more Shares shall be entitled to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote instead
of him at the same general meeting provided that if the Shareholder is the Depository:

(a) | the Depository may appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote at the same general
meeting and each proxy shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the
Depository as the Depository could exercise, including, notwithstanding Regulation 16.2, the
right to vote individually on a show of hands;

(b) unless the Depository specifies otherwise in a written notice to the Company, the Depository
shall be deemed to have appointed as the Depository’s proxies to vote on behalf of the
Depository at a general meeting of the Company each of the Depositors who are individuals
and whose names are shown in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than forty
eight (48) hours prior to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository
to the Company and notwithstanding any other provisions in these Articles, the appointment
of proxies by virtue of this Regulation 17.1(b) shall not require an instrument of proxy or the
lodgement of any instrument of proxy;

(c) | the Company shall accept as valid in all respects the form of instrument of proxy approved
by the Depository (the CDP Proxy Form) for use at the date relevant to the general meeting
in question naming a Depositor (the Nominating Depositor) and permitting that Nominating
Depositor to nominate a person or persons (other than himself, where the Depositor is an
individual) as the proxy or proxies appointed by the Depository. The Company shall, in
determining rights to vote and other matters in respect of a completed CDP Proxy Form
submitted to it, have regard to the instructions given by and the notes (if any) set out in the
CDP Proxy Form. The submission of any CDP Proxy Form shall not affect the operation
of Regulation 17.1(b) and shall not preclude a Depositor appointed as a proxy by virtue
of Regulation 17.1(6) from attending and voting at the relevant meeting but in the event
of attendance by such Depositor the CDP Proxy Form submitted bearing his name as the
Nominating Depositor shall be deemed to be revoked;

(d) | the Company shall reject any CDP Proxy Form of a Nominating Depositor if his name is not
shown in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than forty eight (48) hours prior
to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository to the Company; and

(e) ona poll the maximum number of votes which a Depositor, or proxies appointed pursuant
to a CDP Proxy Form in respect of that Depositor, is able to cast shall be the number of
Shares credited to the Securities Account of that Depositor as shown in the records of the

Depository as at a time not earlier than forty eight (48) hours prior to the time of the relevant
general meeting supplied by the Depository to the Company, whether that number is greater
or smaller than the number specified in any CDP Proxy Form or instrument of proxy executed
by or on behalf of the Depository.

In any case where an instrument of proxy appoints more than one proxy (including the case when a
CDP Proxy Form is used), the proportion of the shareholding concerned to be represented by each
proxy shall be specified in the instrument of proxy.

A proxy need not be a Shareholder. In addition, subject to Regulation 17.1, a proxy or proxies
representing either a Shareholder who is an individual or a Shareholder which is a corporation shall
be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Shareholder which he or they represent
as such Shareholder could exercise, including, notwithstanding Regulation 16.2, the right to vote
individually on a show of hands. On a poll, a proxy need not use all the votes he is entitled to cast
or cast all such votes in the same way.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing and:
(a) in the case of an individual, shall be:

(i) signed by the appointor or his attorney duly authorised in writing if the instrument is
delivered personally or sent by post; or

(ii) authorised by that individual through such method and in such manner as may be
approved by the Directors, if the instrument is submitted by electronic communication;
and

(b) in the case of a corporation, shall be:

(i) either given under its seal or signed on its behalf by an officer, attorney or other
person authorised to sign the same or, in the case of the Depository, signed by its duly
authorised officer by some method or system of mechanical signature as the Depository
may deem appropriate, if the instrument is delivered personally or by post. In the case
of an instrument of proxy purporting to be signed on behalf of a corporation by an
officer thereof it shall be assumed, unless the contrary appears, that such officer was
duly authorised to sign such instrument of proxy on behalf of the corporation without
further evidence of the fact; or

(ii) authorised by that corporation through such method and in such manner as may be
approved by the Directors, if the instrument is submitted by electronic communication.

The Directors may, for the purposes of Regulations 17.4(a)(ii) and 17.4(b)(ii), designate procedures
for authenticating any such instrument, and any such instrument not so authenticated by use of such
procedures shall be deemed not to have been received by the Company.

The Directors may, in their absolute discretion:
(a) approve the method and manner for an instrument appointing a proxy to be authorised and
(b) | designate the procedure for authenticating an instrument appointing a proxy,

as contemplated in Regulations 17.4(a)(ii) and 17.4(b)(ii) for application to such Shareholders or class
of Shareholders as they may determine. Where the Directors do not so approve and designate in
relation to a Shareholder (whether of a class or otherwise), Regulation 17.4(a)(i) and/or (as the case
may be) Regulation 17.4(b)(i) shall apply.

The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Board) the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) under which it is signed on behalf of the appointor (which shall, for this purpose,
include a Depositor), or a certified copy of such power or authority:

(a) if sent personally by post, must be delivered to such place or one of such places (if any) as
may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to or in any document accompanying

the notice convening the meeting (or, if no place is so specified at the Registration Office or
the registered office, as may be appropriate); or

(b) — If submitted by electronic communication, must be received through such means as may be
specified for that purpose in or by way of note to or in any document accompanying the notice
convening the meeting,

and in either case, not less than forty eight (48) hours before the time appointed for holding the
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote or,
in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not less
than twenty four (24) hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in default the
instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid
after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date named in it as the date of its execution,
except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in
cases where the meeting was originally held within twelve (12) months from such date. Delivery
of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a Shareholder from attending and voting
in person at the meeting convened and in such event, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be
deemed to be revoked.

The Directors may, in their absolute discretion, and in relation to such Shareholders or class of
Shareholders as they may determine, specify the means through which instruments appointing a
proxy may be submitted by electronic communications, as contemplated in Regulation 17.6(b).
Where the Directors do not so specify in relation to a Shareholder (whether of a class or otherwise),
Regulation 17.6(a) shall apply.

Instruments of proxy shall be in any usual or common form (including any form approved from time
to time by the Depository) or in such other form as the Board may approve (provided that this shall
not preclude the use of the two-way form) and the Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with the notice
of any meeting forms of instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of proxy shall be
deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any amendment of
a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy
shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for
the meeting to which it relates.

A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding
the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of the
authority under which it was executed, provided that no intimation in writing of such death, insanity
or revocation shall have been received by the Company at the registered office or the Registration
Office (or such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy in the
notice convening the meeting or other document sent therewith) two (2) hours at least before the
commencement of the meeting.

duly appointed attorney and the provisions of these Articles relating to proxies and instruments
appointing proxies shall apply mutatis mutandis in relation to any such attorney and the instrument
under which such attorney is appointed.

CORPORATIONS ACTING BY REPRESENTATIVES

Any corporation which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other governing body
authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or at
any meeting of any class of Shareholders. The person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the
same powers on behalf of such corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual
Shareholder and such corporation shall for the purposes of these Articles be deemed to be present
in person at any such meeting if a person so authorised is present thereat.

Where a Shareholder is the Depository (or its nominee, in each case, being a corporation), it may
authorise such persons as it thinks fit to act as its representatives at any meeting of the Company or
at any meeting of any class of Shareholders provided that the authorisation shall specify the number

and class of Shares in respect of which each such representative is so authorised. Each person
so authorised under the provisions of this Regulation shall be entitled to exercise the same rights
and powers as if such person was the registered holder of the Shares of the Company held by the
Depository (or its nominee) in respect of the number and class of Shares specified in the relevant
authorisation including the right to vote individually on a show of hands.

Any reference in these Articles to a duly authorised representative of a Shareholder being a
corporation shall mean a representative authorised under the provisions of this Regulation.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives
of persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a Shareholder
shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which, the person
is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the Board may in good faith seek legal advice
from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule,
the Board may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the
Company.

WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Subject to the Act, an action that may be taken by the Shareholders at a meeting may also be taken
by a resolution in writing signed (in such manner as to indicate, expressly or impliedly, unconditional
approval) by or on behalf of a majority of in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the votes of all persons
for the time being entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings of the
Company, without the need for any notice, and such written resolution shall, for the purposes of these
Articles, be treated as an Ordinary Resolution duly passed at a general meeting of the Company and,
where relevant, provided a majority of in excess of seventy five (75%) of the votes of all persons for
the time being entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meeting of the Company
is obtained, as a 75% Resolution of Shareholders so passed.

The consent may be in the form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more
Shareholders. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different
dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the earliest date upon which Shareholders holding a
sufficient number of votes of Shares to constitute an Ordinary Resolution or a 75% Resolution of
Shareholders (as the case may be) have consented to the resolution by signed counterparts. But
if any Ordinary Resolution or 75% Resolution of Shareholders is adopted otherwise than by the
unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent to
all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution.

Notwithstanding any provisions contained in these Articles, a resolution in writing shall not be passed
for the purpose of removing a Director before the expiration of his term of office under Regulation
20.5 or for the purposes set out in Regulation 41 relating to the removal and appointment of the
Auditor.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The first Directors of the Company shall be appointed by the first registered agent within six (6)
months of the date of incorporation of the Company; and thereafter, the Directors shall be elected
by Ordinary Resolution. If, before the Company has any Shareholders, all of the Directors appointed
by the registered agent resign or die or otherwise cease to exist, the registered agent may appoint
one or more further persons as Directors of the Company.

No person shall be appointed as a Director or alternate Director, or nominated as a reserve Director,
of the Company unless he has consented in writing to be a Director or alternate Director, or to be
nominated as a reserve Director.

Subject to Regulation 20.1, the Company may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution determine
the maximum number of Directors and increase or reduce the number of Directors but so that the
minimum number of Directors shall not be less than two (2). All Directors shall be natural persons.

Subject to Regulations 21.1, 21.3 and 23.1, each Director holds office for the term, if any, fixed by
the Ordinary Resolution appointing him, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject
to Regulations 21.1, 21.3 and 23.1, if no term is fixed on the appointment of a Director, the Director
serves indefinitely until his earlier death, resignation or removal.

Subject to any provision to the contrary in these Articles the Shareholders may, at any general
meeting convened and held in accordance with these Articles, by Ordinary Resolution remove a
Director at any time before the expiration of his period of office notwithstanding anything in these
Articles or in any agreement between the Company and such Director (but without prejudice to
any claim for damages under any such agreement) provided that the Notice of any such meeting
convened for the purpose of removing a Director shall contain a statement of the intention so to do
and be served on such Director fourteen (14) days before the meeting and at such meeting such
Director shall be entitled to be heard on the motion for his removal.

A vacancy on the Board created by the removal of a Director under the provisions of Regulation 20.5
above may be filled by the election or appointment by Ordinary Resolution at the meeting at which
such Director is removed or, in the absence of such election or appointment, such general meeting
may authorise the Board to appoint a Director to fill any vacancy in the number left unfilled.

A vacancy in relation to Directors occurs if a Director dies or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to
the expiration of his term of office.

The Company may by Ordinary Resolution appoint any person to be a Director either as an additional
Director or to fill a casual vacancy. The Board shall also have power from time to time to appoint any
person to be a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or, where the maximum number of Directors has
been determined by the Shareholders and the Shareholders have authorised the Board to appoint
additional Directors, as an additional Director. Where the Board appoints a person as Director to fill
a vacancy, the term shall not exceed the term that remained when the person who has ceased to be
a Director ceased to hold office, but in any event, such person so appointed by the Board as Director
shall hold office only until the next annual general meeting of the Company. Such Director shall then
be eligible for re-election, but shall not be taken into account in determining the number of Directors
who are to retire by rotation at such meeting.

Neither a Director nor an alternate Director is required to hold a Share as a qualification to office, and
such Director shall be entitled to receive notice of and attend and speak at any general meeting of
the Company and of all classes of Shares.

sole Director of the Company, the sole Shareholder/Director may, by instrument in writing, nominate
a person who is not disqualified from being a Director of the Company as a reserve Director of the
Company to act in the place of the sole Director in the event of his death.

RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS

Any Director appointed by the Board shall retire at the next annual general meeting of the Company
and shall then be eligible for re-election at that meeting.

A Director may resign his office by giving written Notice of his resignation to the Company and the
resignation has effect from the date the Notice is received by the Company or from such later date
as may be specified in the Notice. A Director shall resign forthwith as a Director if he is, or becomes,
disqualified from acting as a Director under the Act.

Each Director shall retire at least once every three (3) years. A retiring Director shall be eligible for
re-election.

The Shareholders may, at the meeting at which a Director retires under any provision of these
Articles, by Ordinary Resolution fill the office being vacated by electing thereto the retiring Director
or some other person eligible for appointment. In default the retiring Director shall be deemed to
have been re-elected except in any of the following cases:

(a) where at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such office or a resolution for the re-
election of such Director is put to the meeting and lost; or

(b) | where such Director has given notice in writing to the Company that he is unwilling to be re-
elected.

The retirement shall not have effect until the conclusion of the meeting except where a resolution
is passed to elect some other person in the place of the retiring Director or a resolution for his
re-election is put to the meeting and lost and accordingly a retiring Director who is re-elected or
deemed to have been re-elected will continue in office without a break.

A person who is not a retiring Director shall be eligible for election to office of Director at any general
meeting if a Shareholder intending to propose him has, at least eleven (11) clear days before the
meeting, left at the registered office a Notice duly signed by the nominee, giving his consent to the
nomination and signifying his candidature for the office, or the intention of such Shareholder to
propose him. In the case of a person recommended by the Directors for election, nine (9) clear days’
Notice only shall be necessary. Notice of each and every candidature for election to the Board shall
be served on the Shareholders at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting at which the election is to
take place.

The nomination of a person as a reserve Director of the Company ceases to have effect if:
(a) before the death of the sole Shareholder/Director who nominated him:

(i) he resigns as reserve Director, or

(ii) the sole Shareholder/Director revokes the nomination in writing; or

(b) | thesole Shareholder/Director who nominated him ceases to be able to be the sole Shareholder/
Director of the Company for any reason other than his death.

VACATING OF OFFICE
The office of a Director shall be vacated if the Director:

(a) resigns his office by Notice in writing delivered to the Company at the registered office or
tendered at a meeting of the Board;

(6) | becomes of unsound mind or dies;

(c) without special leave of absence from the Board, is absent from meetings of the Board for six
(6) consecutive months, and his alternate Director, if any, shall not during such period have
attended in his stead and the Board resolves that his office be vacated; or

(d) | becomes bankrupt or has a receiving order made against him or suspends payment or
compounds with his creditors;

(e) is prohibited by law from being a Director;

(f) ceases to be a Director by virtue of any provision of the Act or is removed from office pursuant
to these Articles; or

(g) | becomes disqualified from acting as a director in any jurisdiction for reasons other than on
technical grounds (in which event he must immediately resign from the Board).

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The Board may from time to time appoint any one or more of its body to be a managing director or
a person holding an equivalent position, joint managing director or deputy managing director or to
hold any other employment or executive office with the Company for such period (subject to their
continuance as Directors) and upon such terms as the Board may determine and the Board may
revoke or terminate any of such appointments. Any such revocation or termination as aforesaid shall
be without prejudice to any claim for damages that such Director may have against the Company or
the Company may have against such Director. A Director appointed to an office under this Regulation
shall be subject to the same provisions as to removal as the other Directors of the Company, and

he shall (Subject to the provisions of any contract between him and the Company) ipso facto and
immediately cease to hold such office if he shall cease to hold the office of Director for any cause.
Where the appointment is for a fixed term, such term shall not exceed five (5) years.

A managing director or a person holding an equivalent position shall at all times be subject to the
control of the Board but subject thereto the Board may from time to time entrust to and confer upon
a managing director for the time being such of the powers exercisable under these Articles by the
Board as they may think fit and may confer such powers for such time and to be exercised on such
terms and conditions and with such restrictions as they think expedient and they may confer such
powers either collaterally with or to the exclusion of and in substitution for all or any of the powers of
the Board in that behalf and may from time to time revoke, withdraw, alter or vary all or any of such
powers.

Notwithstanding Regulation 25, an executive director appointed to an office under Regulation 23.1
hereof shall receive such remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in
profits or otherwise or by all or any of those modes) and such other benefits (including pension
and/or gratuity and/or other benefits on retirement) and allowances as the Board may from time to
time determine, and either in addition to or in lieu of his remuneration as a Director, but he shall not
in any circumstances be remunerated by a commission on or a percentage of turnover.

ALTERNATE DIRECTORS

Any Director may at any time by Notice delivered to the registered office or head office or at a
meeting of the Directors appoint any person (other than another Director) to be his alternate Director.
Subject to compliance with Regulation 20.2, such appointment, unless previously approved by a
majority of the Board, shall have effect only upon and subject to being so approved. Any person
so appointed shall have all the rights and powers of the Director or Directors for wnom such person
is appointed in the alternative provided that such person shall not be counted more than once in
determining whether or not a quorum is present. An alternate Director may be removed at any
time by the person who appointed him or by the Board and, subject thereto, the office of alternate
Director shall continue until the Director for whom such alternate Director was appointed ceases for
any reason to be a Director. Any appointment or removal of an alternate Director may be effected
by written Notice signed by the appointor and delivered to the registered office or head office or
tendered at a meeting of the Board. An alternate Director may not act as alternate to more than one
Director. An alternate Director shall be entitled to receive notices of meetings of the Board or of
committees of the Board and any written resolution circulated for written consent to the same extent
as the Director appointing him and shall be entitled to such extent to attend and vote as a Director
at any such meeting at which the Director appointing him is not personally present and generally at
such meeting to exercise and discharge all the functions, powers and duties of his appointor as a
Director and for the purposes of the proceedings at such meeting the provisions of these Articles
shall apply as if he were a Director.

An alternate Director shall only be a Director for the purposes of the Act and shall only be subject
to the provisions of the Act insofar as they relate to the duties and obligations of a Director when
performing the functions of the Director for whom he is appointed in the alternative and shall alone
be responsible to the Company for his acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent
of or for the Director appointing him. An alternate Director shall be entitled to contract and be
interested in and benefit from contracts or arrangements or transactions and to be repaid expenses
and to be indemnified by the Company to the same extent mutatis mutandis as if he were a Director
but he shall not be entitled to receive from the Company any fee in his capacity as an alternate
Director except only such part, if any, of the remuneration otherwise payable to his appointor as
such appointor may by Notice to the Company from time to time direct.

An alternate Director has no power to appoint a further alternate, whether of the appointing Director
or of the alternate Director.

If the appointor of an alternate Director is for the time being absent from his usual place of residence
or otherwise not available or unable to act, the signature of an alternate Director to any resolution in
writing of the Board or a committee of the Board of which his appointor is a member shall, unless the
notice of his appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of his appointor.

reason to be a Director, however, such alternate Director or any other person may be re-appointed
by the Directors to serve as an alternate Director PROVIDED always that, if at any meeting any
Director retires but is re-elected at the same meeting, any appointment of such alternate Director
pursuant to these Articles which was in force immediately before his retirement shall remain in force
as though he had not retired.

DIRECTORS’ FEES AND EXPENSES

The ordinary remuneration of the Directors shall, from time to time, be determined by Ordinary
Resolution in general meeting. Such remuneration shall not be increased except pursuant to an
Ordinary Resolution passed at a general meeting where notice of the proposed increase shall have
been given in the Notice convening the general meeting, and shall (unless otherwise directed by
the resolution by which it is voted) be divided amongst the Board in such proportions and in such
manner as the Board may agree or, failing agreement, equally, except that any Director who shall
hold office for part only of the period in respect of which such remuneration is payable shall be
entitled only to rank in such division for a proportion of remuneration related to the period during
which he has held office. Such remuneration shall be deemed to accrue from day to day.

Each Director shall be entitled to be repaid or prepaid all travelling, hotel and incidental expenses
reasonably incurred or expected to be incurred by him in attending meetings of the Board or
committees of the Board or general meetings or separate meetings of any class of Shares or of
debentures of the Company or otherwise in connection with the discharge of his duties as a Director.

Any Director who, by request, goes or resides abroad for any purpose of the Company or who
performs services which in the opinion of the Board go beyond the ordinary duties of a Director may
be paid such extra remuneration (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profits or
otherwise) as the Board may determine and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to or in
substitution for any ordinary remuneration provided for by or pursuant to any other Regulation.

The remuneration (including any remuneration under Regulation 25.3 above) in the case of a Director
other than an executive Director shall be payable by a fixed sum and shall not at any time be
by commission on or percentage of the profits or turnover, and no Director whether an executive
Director or otherwise shall be remunerated by a commission on or percentage of turnover.

the Director is contractually entitled).

GENERAL POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business of the Company shall be managed and conducted by the Board, which may pay all
expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the Company and may
exercise all powers of the Company (whether relating to the management of the business of the
Company or otherwise) except powers that by the Act or by the Memorandum or these Articles are
required to be exercised by Shareholders. The general powers given by this Regulation shall not be
limited or restricted by any special authority or power given to the Board by any other Regulation.

Any person contracting or dealing with the Company in the ordinary course of business shall be
entitled to rely on any written or oral contract or agreement or deed, document or instrument entered
into or executed as the case may be by any two (2) of the Directors acting jointly on behalf of the
Company and the same shall be deemed to be validly entered into or executed by the Company as
the case may be and shall, subject to any rule of law, be binding on the Company.

Each Director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the
Company acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each
Director, in exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in
what the Director believes to be the best interests of the Company.

business or transaction or participation in the profits thereof or in the general profits of the
Company either in addition to or in substitution for a salary or other remuneration.

or more of these modes) and pay the working expenses of any staff employed by them upon the
business of the Company. The Board may delegate to any regional or local board, manager or agent
any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in or exercisable by the Board (other than the
Proscribed Powers or its powers to make calls and forfeit Shares), with power to sub-delegate, and
may authorise the members of any of them to fill any vacancies therein and to act notwithstanding
vacancies. Any such appointment or delegation may be made upon such terms and subject to
such conditions as the Board may think fit, and the Board may remove any person appointed as
aforesaid, and may revoke or vary such delegation, but no person dealing in good faith and without
notice of any such revocation or variation shall be affected thereby.

The Board may by power of attorney appoint under the Seal any company, firm or person or any
fluctuating body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Board, to be the attorney
or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions
(not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Board under these Articles) and for such period

managing director, an executive director or any Director any of the powers exercisable by it upon
such terms and conditions and with such restrictions as it thinks fit, and either collaterally with, or
to the exclusion of, its own powers, and may from time to time revoke or vary all or any of such
powers but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of such revocation or variation shall
be affected thereby.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a parent, a Director of the Company may, when
exercising powers or performing duties as a Director, act ina manner which he believes is in the best
interests of the parent even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

additional to those, if any, to which such employees or ex-employees or their dependants are or
may become entitled under any such scheme or fund as mentioned in Regulation 26.11. Any such
pension or benefit may, as the Board considers desirable, be granted to an employee either before
and in anticipation of or upon or at any time after his actual retirement.

BORROWING POWERS

The Board may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to raise or borrow
money, incur indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the
undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and, subject to the Act, to issue debentures,
bonds and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, liability or obligation
of the Company or of any third party.

Debentures, bonds and other securities may be made assignable free from any equities between the
Company and the person to whom the same may be issued.

Any debentures, bonds or other securities may be issued at a discount, premium or otherwise and
with any special privileges as to redemption, drawings, allotment of Shares, attending and voting at
general meetings of the Company, appointment of Directors and otherwise.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

The Board or any committee thereof may meet for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise
regulate its meetings in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as it
considers appropriate. Questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by a majority of votes.
In the case of any equality of votes (except where only two (2) Directors are present and form the
quorum or when only two (2) Directors are competent to vote on the matter at issue) the chairman of
the meeting shall have an additional or casting vote.

A meeting of the Board may be convened by the Secretary on request of a Director or by any
Director. The Secretary shall convene a meeting of the Board of which not less than three (3) days’
Notice may be given in writing or in such other manner as the Board may from time to time determine
whenever he shall be required so to do by the President or chairman, as the case may be, or any
Director. A meeting of Directors held without three (3) days’ Notice having been given to all Directors
shall be valid if all the Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive Notice of the
meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a Director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that
Director. The inadvertent failure to give Notice of a meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director
has not received the Notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

Directors may participate in any meeting of the Board by means of such telephone, electronic or
other communication facilities as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with
each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Board may be fixed by the Board
and, unless so fixed at any other number, shall be two (2). An alternate Director shall be counted in
a quorum in the case of the absence of a Director for whom he is the alternate.

A meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all the powers,
authorities and discretions for the time being vested in or exercisable by the Board.

Any Director who ceases to be a Director at a Board meeting may continue to be present and to act
as a Director and be counted in the quorum until the termination of such Board meeting if no other
Director objects and if otherwise a quorum of Directors would not be present.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

The continuing Directors or a sole continuing Director may act notwithstanding any vacancy in the
Board provided that if the number of Directors is reduced below the minimum number fixed by or in
accordance with these Articles as the quorum, the continuing Directors or Director, notwithstanding
that the number of Directors is below the number fixed by or in accordance with these Articles as the
quorum or that there is only one continuing Director may, except in an emergency, act only for the
purpose of increasing the number of Directors to such minimum number, or summoning a general
meeting of the Company. If there be no Directors or Director able or willing to act, then any two (2)
Shareholders may summon a general meeting for the purpose of appointing Directors.

If the Company has only one (1) Director the provisions herein contained for meetings of Directors do
not apply and such sole Director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as
are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In
lieu of minutes of a meeting the sole Director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum
of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient
evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

The Board may elect a chairman and one or more deputy chairman of its meetings and determine
the period for which they are respectively to hold such office. If no chairman or deputy chairman is
elected, or if at any meeting neither the chairman nor any deputy chairman is present within five (5)
minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the Directors present may choose one of their
number to be chairman of the meeting.

28.10 A resolution in writing signed by the majority of Directors shall be as valid and effectual as if a

28.11

29
29.1

29.2

resolution had been passed at a meeting of the Board duly convened and held provided that such
number of Directors approving the resolution is sufficient to constitute a quorum and that a copy of
such resolution has been given or the contents thereof communicated to all the Directors for the time
being entitled to receive notices of Board meetings in the same manner as notices of meetings are
required to be given by these Articles, and further provided that no Director approving the resolution
is aware of or has received any objection to the resolution from any Director. Such resolution may be
contained in one document or in several documents in like form each signed by one or more of the
Directors or alternate Directors and for this purpose a facsimile signature of a Director or an alternate
Director shall be treated as valid. If the consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts
bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last director
forming a majority has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts. The expressions “in
writing” and “signed” include approval by any such Director by telefax or any form of electronic
communication approved by the Directors for such purpose from time to time in accordance with
the Statutes.

All acts done in good faith by the Board or by any committee or by any person acting as a Director
or members of a committee, shall, notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that there was
some defect in the appointment of any member of the Board or such committee or person acting
as aforesaid or that they or any of them were disqualified or had vacated office, be as valid as if
every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a Director or
member of such committee.

COMMITTEES
The Board may, by Resolution of Directors:

(a) designate one or more committees, each consisting of one or more Directors, and delegate
one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal, to the committee; and

(b) — from time to time, revoke such delegation or revoke the appointment of and discharge any such
committees either wholly or in part, and either as to persons or purposes. Any committee so
formed shall, in the exercise of the powers, authorities and discretions so delegated, conform
to any directions which may be imposed on it by the Board.

The Board has no power to delegate to a committee of Directors any of the Proscribed Powers.

THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

Acommittee of Directors, where authorised by the Resolution of Directors appointing such committee
or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, may appoint a sub-committee and delegate powers
exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of Directors consisting of two (2) or more Directors
shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of
Directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors
establishing the committee.

Where the Directors delegate their powers to a committee of Directors they remain responsible for
the exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times
before the exercise of the power that the committee would exercise the power in conformity with the
duties imposed on Directors of the Company under the Act.

All acts done by any such committee in conformity with such directions, and in fulfilment of the
purposes for which it was appointed, but not otherwise, shall have like force and effect as if done by
the Board, and the Board shall have power, with the consent of the Company by Ordinary Resolution,
to remunerate the members of any such committee, and charge such remuneration to the current
expenses of the Company.

MANAGERS

The Board may from time to time by Resolution of Directors appoint a general manager, a manager or
managers of the Company and may fix his or their remuneration either by way of salary or commission
or by conferring the right to participation in the profits of the Company or by a combination of
two (2) or more of these modes and pay the working expenses of any of the staff of the general
manager, manager or managers who may be employed by him or them upon the business of the
Company.

The appointment of such general manager, manager or managers may be for such period as the
Board may decide, and the Board may confer upon him or them all or any of the powers of the Board
as it may think fit.

The Board may by Resolution of Directors enter into such agreement or agreements with any such
general manager, manager or managers upon such terms and conditions in all respects as the Board
may in their absolute discretion think fit, including a power for such general manager, manager or
managers to appoint an assistant manager or managers or other employees whatsoever under them

of them directors, managing directors, joint managing directors, deputy managing directors,
executive directors, managers or other officers of such company) or voting or providing for the
payment of remuneration to the director, managing director, joint managing director, deputy
managing director, executive director, manager or other officers of such other company and
any Director may vote in favour of the exercise of such voting rights in such manner aforesaid
notwithstanding that he may be, or about to be, appointed a director, managing director, joint
managing director, deputy managing director, executive director, manager or other officer of
such a company, and that as such he may become interested in the exercise of such voting
rights in the manner aforesaid.

Subject to the Act and to these Articles, no Director or proposed or intending Director shall be
disqualified by his office from contracting with the Company, either with regard to his tenure of
any office or place of profit or as vendor, purchaser or in any other manner whatever, nor shall any
such contract or any other contract or arrangement in which any Director is in any way interested
be liable to be avoided, nor shall any Director so contracting or being so interested be liable to
account to the Company or the Shareholders for any remuneration, profit or other benefits realised
by any such contract or arrangement by reason of such Director holding that office or of the fiduciary
relationship thereby established provided that such Director shall disclose the nature of his interest
in any contract or arrangement in which he is interested in accordance with Regulation 32.3 herein.

A Director who to his knowledge is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in a contract
or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement with the Company shall declare the nature
of his interest at the meeting of the Board at which the question of entering into the contract or
arrangement is first considered, if he knows his interest then exists, or in any other case at the first
meeting of the Board after he knows that he is or has become so interested. For the purposes of this
Regulation, a general Notice to the Board by a Director to the effect that:

(a) he is a member or officer of a specified company or firm and is to be regarded as interested
in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the Notice be made with that
company or firm; or

(b) heis to be regarded as interested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of
the Notice be made with a specified person who is connected with him,

shall be deemed to be a sufficient declaration of interest under this Regulation in relation to any such
contract or arrangement, provided that no such Notice shall be effective unless either it is given ata
meeting of the Board or the Director takes reasonable steps to secure that it is brought up and read
at the next Board meeting after it is given.

proposed contract or arrangement in which he has directly or indirectly a personal material interest.
Matters in which he shall not be considered to have a personal material interest shall include the
following:

benefit of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

of a debt or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries for which the Director has
himself assumed responsibility in whole or in part whether alone or jointly under a guarantee
or indemnity or by the giving of security;

(c) any contract or arrangement in which he is interested in the same manner as other holders of
Shares or debentures or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by virtue

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

(d) any contract or arrangement concerning any other company in which he is interested only,
whether directly or indirectly, as an officer or executive or a shareholder other than a company
in which the Director together with any of his associates (as defined by the rules or regulations
of the Designated Stock Exchange) is beneficially interested in (other than through his interest
(if any) in the Company) five (5) percent or more of the issued shares or of the voting rights
of any class of shares of such company (or any third company through which his interest is
derived); or

(e) any proposal concerning the adoption, modification or operation of a share option scheme,
a pension fund or retirement, death or disability benefits scheme or other arrangement which
relates both to Directors and employees of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries and does
not provide in respect of any Director as such any privilege or advantage not accorded to the
employees to which such scheme or fund relates.

A company shall be deemed to be a company in which a Director owns five percent (5%) or more
if and so long as (but only if and so long as) he and his associates (as defined by the rules or
regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange), (either directly or indirectly) are the holders of or
beneficially interested in (other than through his interest (if any) in the Company) five percent (5%)
or more of any class of the equity share capital of such company or of the voting rights available
to members of such company (or of any third company through which his interest is derived). For
the purpose of this paragraph there shall be disregarded any shares held by a Director as bare or
custodian trustee and in which he has no beneficial interest, any shares comprised in a trust in which
the Director’s interest is in reversion or remainder if and so long as some other person is entitled to
receive the income thereof, and any shares comprised in an authorised unit trust scheme in which
the Director is interested only as a unit holder.

Where a company in which a Director together with his associates (as defined by the rules
or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange) holds five percent (5%) or more is materially
interested in a contract or transaction, then that Director shall also be deemed materially interested
in such contract or transaction.

If any question shall arise at any meeting of the Board as to the materiality of the interest of a
Director (other than the chairman of the meeting) or as to the entitlement of any Director (other than
such chairman) to vote and such question is not resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain
from voting, such question shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and his ruling in relation
to such other Director shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or extent of
the interest of the Director concerned as known to such Director has not been fairly disclosed to
the Board. If any question as aforesaid shall arise in respect of the chairman of the meeting such
question shall be decided by a resolution of the Board (for which purpose such chairman shall not
vote thereon) and such resolution shall be final and conclusive except in a case where the nature or
extent of the interest of such chairman as known to such chairman has not been fairly disclosed to
the Board.

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company shall indemnify against all expenses,
including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably
incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who:

(a) is Or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
the person is or was a Director of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a Director of, or in any other capacity
is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

The indemnity in Regulation 33.1 only applies if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a
view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had
no reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

APPENDIX A —
THE PROPOSED NEW MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES

For the purposes of Regulation 33.2 and without limitation, a Director acts in the best interests of the
Company if he acts in the best interests of the Company’s parent in the circumstances specified in
Regulation 26.8.

The decision of the Directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a
view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the
Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of
a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in
good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable
cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a Director in defending any legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such
proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director to repay the amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that the Director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in
accordance with Regulation 33.1.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former Director in defending any legal, administrative
or investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of
such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former Director to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the former Director is not entitled to be indemnified
by the Company in accordance with Regulation 33.1 and upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Company deems appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section
is not exclusive of any other rights to which the person seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any agreement, Ordinary Resolution, resolution of disinterested
Directors or otherwise, both as to acting in the person’s official capacity and as to acting in another
capacity while serving as a Director of the Company.

If a person referred to in Regulation 33.1 has been successful in defence of any proceedings referred
to in Regulation 33.1, the person is entitled to be indemnified against all expenses, including legal
fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by
the person in connection with the proceedings.

Director, officer or liquidator of the Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was
serving as a Director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted
against the person and incurred by the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or
would have had the power to indemnify the person against the liability as provided in the Articles.

The Company shall keep a Register of Directors containing:

(a) | thenames and addresses of the persons who are Directors of the Company or who have been

The Company shall have a Seal an impression of which shall be kept at the office of the registered
agent of the Company. The Company may have more than one Seal and references herein to
the Seal shall be references to every Seal which shall have been duly adopted by Resolution of
Directors. The Directors shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal and for an imprint thereof to
be kept at the registered office.

Subject as otherwise provided in these Articles, any instrument to which a Seal is affixed shall be
witnessed and signed autographically by one (1) Director and the Secretary or by two (2) Directors or
by such other person (including a Director) or persons so authorised from time to time by Resolution
of Directors, either before or after the Seal is affixed, and either generally or in any particular case,
save that as regards any certificates for Shares or debentures or other securities of the Company

dispensed with or affixed by some method or system of mechanical signature.

For the purpose of sealing documents creating or evidencing securities issued by the Company, the
Company may have a securities seal which is a facsimile of the Seal with the addition of the words

AUTHENTICATION OF DOCUMENTS

and accurate record of proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

and it shall conclusively be presumed in favour of the Company that every entry in the Register of
Members purporting to be made on the basis of any such documents so destroyed was duly and
properly made and every share certificate so destroyed was a valid certificate duly and properly
cancelled and that every instrument of transfer so destroyed was a valid and effective instrument
duly and properly registered and that every other document destroyed hereunder was a valid and
effective document in accordance with the recorded particulars thereof in the books or records of
the Company. Provided always that:

(i) the foregoing provisions of this Regulation shall apply only to the destruction of a document in
good faith and without express notice to the Company that the preservation of such document
was relevant to a claim;

(ii) nothing contained in this Regulation shall be construed as imposing upon the Company any
liability in respect of the destruction of any such document earlier than as aforesaid or in any
case where the conditions of proviso (i) above are not fulfilled; and

(iii) | references in this Regulation to the destruction of any document include references to its
disposal in any manner.

DISTRIBUTIONS BY WAY OF DIVIDEND

The Board may, by Resolution of Directors, authorise a distribution by way of dividend at a time and
of an amount they think fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that, immediately after the
distribution, the value of the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company will be
able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Dividends may be paid in any currency and such dividend may be paid in cash or wholly or partly in
specie in which case the Board may fix the value for distribution in specie of any assets.

Without prejudice to the generality of Regulation 39.2 and subject always to Regulation 39.1, if at
any time the Shares of the Company are divided into different classes, the Board may by Resolution
of Directors pay such dividends in respect of those Shares which confer on the holders thereof
deferred or non-preferential rights as well as in respect of those Shares which confer on the holders
thereof preferential rights with regard to dividends and provided that the Board acts bona fide
the Board shall not incur any responsibility to the holders of Shares conferring any preference for
any damage that they may suffer by reason of the payment of any dividend on any Shares having
deferred or non-preferential rights and may also pay periodically any fixed dividend which is payable
on any Shares of the Company.

Except in so far as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any Share otherwise provide:

(a) all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the Shares in
respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a Share in advance of calls
shall be treated for the purposes of this Regulation as paid up on the Share; and

(b) all dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the
Shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid.

The Board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to a Shareholder by the Company
on or in respect of any Shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company
on account of calls or otherwise.

Any dividend or other sum payable in cash to the holder of Shares may be paid by cheque or
warrant sent through the post addressed to the holder at his registered address or, in the case
of joint holders, addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register of Members in

respect of the Shares at his address as appearing in the Register of Members or addressed to such
person and at such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such cheque
or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint holders otherwise direct, be made payable to the order of
the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first on the
Register of Members in respect of such Shares, and shall be sent at his or their risk and payment
of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall constitute a good discharge to the
Company notwithstanding that it may subsequently appear that the same has been stolen or that
any endorsement thereon has been forged. Any one (1) of two (2) or more joint holders may give
effectual receipts for any dividends or other moneys payable or property distributable in respect of
the Shares held by such joint holders.

All dividends or bonuses unclaimed for one (1) year after having been declared may be invested or
otherwise made use of by Resolution of Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. Any
dividend or bonuses unclaimed after a period of six (6) years from the date of declaration shall be
forfeited by Resolution of Directors and shall revert to the Company. The payment by the Board of
any unclaimed dividend or other sums payable on or in respect of a Share into a separate account
shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect thereof.

No dividend or distribution or other moneys payable by the Company shall bear interest as against
the Company and no dividend shall be paid on treasury shares.

Where a Resolution of Directors resolves that a dividend be satisfied wholly or in part by the
distribution of specific assets of any kind, and in particular of shares or debentures or warrants to
subscribe for securities of another company, or in any one or more of such ways, and where any
difficulty arises in regard to the distribution the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient, and
may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets, or any part thereof, and may determine that
cash payments shall be made to any Shareholders upon the footing of the value so fixed in order
to adjust the rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem
expedient to the Board and may appoint any person to sign any requisite instruments of transfer
and other documents on behalf of the persons entitled to the dividend, and such appointment shall
be effective and binding on the Shareholders. The Resolution of Directors may resolve that no such
assets shall be made available to Shareholders with registered addresses in any particular territory
or territories where, in the absence of a registration statement or other special formalities, such
distribution of assets would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable and
in such event the only entitlement of the Shareholders aforesaid shall be to receive cash payments
as aforesaid. Shareholders affected as a result of the foregoing sentence shall not be or be deemed
to be a separate class of Shareholders for any purpose whatsoever.

ACCOUNTING RECORDS
