acquire its own shares without the consent of the Shareholders whose shares are to be
purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the Company is permitted by the Act or
any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
the shares without their consent.

The Company may only offer to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares if the Directors
are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that the Company will, immediately after the purchase,
redemption or other acquisition satisfy the Solvency Test.

Sections 60 (Process for acquisition of own shares) and 61 (Offer to one or more
shareholders) and 62 (shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of company) of the Act
shall not apply to the Company.

shall be cancelled or held as Treasury Shares except to the extent that such shares are in
excess of 20 per cent of the issued shares. in.which case they shall be cancelled but they shall
be available for reissue.

All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be
exercised by the Company while it holds the share as a Treasury Share.

Treasury Shares may be transferred by the Company on such terms and conditions (not
otherwise inconsistent with the Memorandum and the Articles and the Act) as the Company
may by resolution of Directors determine, but subject to the rules of any Relevant Stock
Exchange, and in particular the JSE Listings Requirements which require such transfer to be
treated as if it was a fresh issue of shares for cash.

Subject to compliance with the Act, the rules of the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which
the Company has a primary listing the Company may:

5.1.1. divide its shares, including issued shares, into a larger number of shares; or

new shares (if applicable) must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original shares.

VARIATION OF CLASS RIGHTS

Subject to the provisions of the Act, if at any time there are different classes of shares, the
rights attached to any class (and whether or not the Company is being wound up) may (unless

10
6.2

6.3

6.4

6.5

6.6

6.7

otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) be varied or abrogated in
such manner (if any) as is provided by those rights, or by a resolution of the Shareholders of
that class passed at a separate meeting by a Shareholder or Shareholders holding at least
seventy five per cent of the Voting Rights exercised in relation thereto.

Subject to compliance with the Act, the rules of the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which
the Company has a primary listing, any amendment to the Memorandum or the Articles of the
Company will require a resolution of the Shareholders holding at least seventy-five per cent of
the Voting Rights exercised in relation thereto (in the case of a resolution adopted at a
meeting) or at least seventy-five per cent of the Voting Rights exercisable in relation thereto
(in the case of a written resolution), and any such amendment shall include but not be limited
to:

6.2.1. the alteration of its shares as provided for in Articles 5.1.1, 5.1.2 and 6.1 above;
6.2.2 the creation of any class of shares;

6.2.3 the conversion of one class of shares into one or more other classes of shares; or
6.2.4 the change of name of the Gompany.

Company shall, mutatis mutandis, apply but so that:

6.3.1. at every such separate meeting, the quorum shall be persons present in person or by
duly appointed representative or by proxy holding atleast twenty-five per cent of the
Voting Rights entitled to be exercised and comprising at least three persons present
in person or by duly appointed representative or by proxy, provided that, if at any
adjourned meeting of the holders of any class a quorum as so defined is not present,
those holders who are present in person or by-proxy shall form a quorum;

6.3.2 any holder of shares of the class in question present in person or by proxy may
demand a poll; and

6.3.3 each holder of the shares of the class shall, on a poll, have one vote in respect of
every share of the class held by him.

This Article shall apply to the variation or abrogation of the special rights attached to some
only of the shares of any class as if each group of shares of the class differently treated
formed a separate class, the special rights of which were to be varied or abrogated.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of these Articles relating to meetings of the
Company shall apply, with necessary modifications, to any separate meeting of the holders of
shares of a class held otherwise than in connection with the variation or abrogation of the
rights attached to shares of that class.

Subject to the terms of issue or the rights attached to any shares, the rights or privileges
attached to any class of shares shall be deemed not to be varied or abrogated by the
Directors resolving that a class of shares is to become or cease to be a Participating Security.

The rights attached to any class of shares shall not (unless otherwise provided by the rights
attached to the shares of that class) be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further

11
6.8

7.1

shares ranking in all respects (Save as to the date from which such new shares shall rank for
dividend) pari passu therewith or by the purchase or redemption by the Company of any of its
own shares in accordance with the provisions of the Act and these Articles.

required to complete and have ready for delivery a certificate, shall be entitled without
payment to one certificate for all the shares registered in his name or, if shares of
more than one class are registered in his name, to a separate certificate for each
class of shares so registered. Every certificate shall specify the number and class of
shares in respect of which it is issued, the distinctive numbers, if any, of such shares
and the amounts paid up on them respectively.

Any Shareholder receiving a certificate, shall.indemnify and hold the Company and
the Directors and officers harmless from,any loss or liability which it or they may incur
by reason of any wrongful or fraudulent use of such certificate or representation made
by any person by virtue of the possession of such certificate.

A certificate shall_be delivered to a holder of certificated shares within two months
after the issue or, as the case may be, the lodging with the Company of the transfer
of the shares concerned. A certificate shall be delivered in accordance with, and in
the time period permitted by the rules and regulations applicable to any Relevant
Stock Exchange and of any applicable Relevant System to any holder of
uncertificated shares following the change of those shares to certificated form.

Every certificate for shares.or any other.form of security shall be executed by the
Company in such manner as the Directors may authorise having regard to the terms
of issue and the requirements of any Relevant Stock Exchange on which the
Company’s shares are dealt or traded. The Directors may determine that the
signatures of one or more of the Directors or of the Secretary may be affixed to such
certificates by mechanical or electronic means or may be printed thereon. No
certificate shall be issued representing shares of more than one class.

The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate in respect of
certificated shares held jointly by two or more persons. Delivery of a certificate to the
person first named on the register of Shareholders shall be sufficient delivery to all
joint holders.

Where only some of the shares comprised in a share certificate are transferred, the
old certificate shall be cancelled and a new certificate for the balance of the shares
issued in lieu, and the Shareholder concerned shall be liable for any attendant and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses as the Directors determine.

12
7.2

7.1.9

Subject to Article 7.1.6 and on surrender of the original share certificates for
cancellation:

(a) if any Shareholder requires additional certificates, he shall pay for each additional
certificate such reasonable out of pocket expenses as the Directors determine;

(6) if a Shareholder holding two or more certificates in respect of his shareholding
requires the cancellation of any of those certificates, and the issue of one or more
replacement certificates comprising different numbers of shares, he shall pay for
each replacement certificate such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses as the
Directors determine.

If any certificate is defaced, worn-out, lost or destroyed, a new certificate shall be
issued without charge (other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) and the
person requiring the new certificate shall first surrender the defaced or worn-out
certificate or give such evidence of the loss or destruction of the certificate and such
indemnity to the Company as the Directors may determine.

In the case of shares held jointly by several persons, any such request as is
mentioned in this Article 7 may be made by any one of the joint holders.

Uncertificated Shares

7.2.1

7.2.2

Subject to the Act and the rules and regulations applicable to any Relevant Stock
Exchange and of any applicable Relevant System, the Board, without further
consultation with the holders of any shares or other securities, may resolve that any
class or series of shares from time to time in issue or to be issued may be issued,
held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise dealt with in uncertificated
form in accordance with the CREST Regulations or Strate CSD Rules and Directives
(as applicable) or the rules and regulations applicable to any Relevant Stock
Exchange and of any other applicable Relevant System and no provisions of these
Articles will apply to any uncertificated share to the extent that they are inconsistent
with the holding of such shares in uncertificated form or the transfer of title to any
such shares by means of a Relevant System or any provision of CREST Regulations
or Strate CSD Rules and Directives (as applicable) or the rules and regulations
applicable to any Relevant Stock Exchange and of any applicable other Relevant
System..

Conversion of shares held in certificated form into shares held in uncertificated form,
and vice versa, may be made in such manner as the Board may in its absolute
discretion, think fit (Subject always to the CREST Regulations or Strate CSD Rules
and Directives (as applicable) and the requirements of the Relevant System
concerned). The Company shall enter on the relevant Register of Shareholders how
many shares are held by each Shareholder in uncertificated form and in certificated
form and shall maintain the Register of Shareholders as is required by the CREST
Regulations or Strate CSD Rules and Directives (as applicable) and the Relevant
System concerned. Notwithstanding any provision of these Articles, a class or series
of shares shall not be treated as two classes by virtue only of that class or series
comprising both certificated shares and uncertificated shares or as a result of any
provision of these Articles or the CREST Regulations or Strate CSD Rules and

13
8.2

8.3

8.4

8.5

Directives (as applicable) or the rules and regulations of any other applicable
Relevant System which apply only in respect of certificated or uncertificated shares.

Subject to the rules and regulations applicable to the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which
the Company has a primary listing, each Shareholder may transfer all or any of his shares in
the case of certificated shares by written instrument of transfer in any form approved by the
Directors. Any written instrument shall contain the name and address of the transferee and be
executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer of a share which is not
fully paid) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the
holder of such shares until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of
Shareholders in respect of it.

The Company shall, on receipt.of an instrument of transfer complying with Article 8.2, cause
the name of the transferee of the share to be entered.in the register of Shareholders unless
the Directors resolve to refuse or delay the registration of the transfer.

Subject to the Act and these Articles, a transfer of a share in uncertificated form may be
effected by means of a Relevant System and the operator of the Relevant System shall act as
agent of the Shareholder for the purpose of.ihe transfer of shares.

Subject to the rules and regulations applicable to the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which
the Company has a primary listing, the Directors may in their absolute discretion, provided
that such discretion may not be exercised in such.a way as to prevent dealings in such shares
from taking place on an open and proper basis in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which the Company has a primary listing, and without
giving any reason resolve to refuse or delay the transfer of a certificated share unless:

8.5.1 it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
8.5.2 itis in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees;

8.5.3 it is delivered for registration to the Transfer Agent of the Company, or such other
person as the Directors may from time to time appoint, accompanied (except in the
case of a transfer where a certificate has not been required to be issued) by the
certificate of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors
may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor and the due execution by
him of the transfer instrument or if the transfer instrument is executed by some other
person on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and

8.5.4 — the holding of such shares would not result in a regulatory, pecuniary, legal, taxation
or material administrative disadvantage for the Company or the Shareholders as a
whole including, but not limited to, where such a disadvantage would arise out of the
transfer of any share to a Prohibited Person.

14
8.6

8.7

8.8

8.9

8.10

8.11

The Board may refuse to register the transfer of a share in uncertificated form (or interest in
such share) in any circumstances where refusal is permitted by the rules and practices of the
operator in the Relevant System provided that exercise of such powers does not disturb the
market in such shares.

In addition, the Board may, subject to the rules and regulations of any applicable Relevant
System, refuse to register a transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more
than four persons jointly or made to or by an infant or a person with a mental disorder or a
Prohibited Person.

Without (in relation to a Participating Security) limiting Article 8.5, the Directors may determine
that a transfer of any share shall not be made, and the Directors shall refuse to register any
such transfer of shares which is:

8.8.1 made to a minor;
8.8.2 made to a bankrupt;
8.8.3 made to any person who is, or may be, suffering from mental disorder and either:

(a) has been admitted to hospital in pursuance of an application for admission for
treatment under the Mental Health Act 1983 (an Act of Parliament) or any similar
statute relating to. mental health; or

(6) an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in matters concerning
mental disorder for his detention or for the appointment of a receiver, curator
bonis or other person to exercise powers with respect to his property or affairs.

8.8.4 made to a Prohibited Person.

If the Directors refuse to register a transfer of a share they shall, as soon as possible after the
date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send notice of the refusal to the
transferee. Any instrument of transfer that the Directors refuse to register shall (except in the
case of suspected fraud) be returned to the person depositing it. All instruments of transfer
which are registered may be retained by the Company.

Subject to the rules and regulations applicable to the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which
the Company has a primary listing and of any applicable Relevant System the registration of
transfers of shares or any class of shares may be suspended at such times and for such
periods (not exceeding thirty days in any year) as the Directors may from time to time
determine (subject to the CREST Regulations and Strate CSD Rules and Directives or the
rules and regulations of any applicable Relevant System). Notice of closure of the register of
Shareholders shall be given in accordance with the requirements of the Act.

If the Directors are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to shares has been signed
but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, the Directors may:

8.11.1 accept such evidence of the transfer of shares as they consider appropriate; and

8.11.2 determine that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of
Shareholders notwithstanding the absence of the instrument of transfer.

instrument relating to or affecting the title to any shares or otherwise for making any entry in
the register of Shareholders affecting the title of any shares.

COMPULSORY TRANSFER OF SHARES

If it shall come to the notice of the Board that any shares are or may be owned or held directly
or beneficially by any Prohibited Person the Board may serve written notice (hereinafter called
a "Transfer Notice") upon the person (or any one of such persons whose shares are
registered in joint names) appearing in the register of Shareholders as the holder (the
"Vendor") of any of the shares concerned (the "Prohibited Shares") requiring the Vendor
within ten days (or such extended time as in all the circumstances the Board consider
reasonable) to transfer (and/or procure the disposal of interests in) the Prohibited Shares to
another person who, in the sole and conclusive determination of the Board, would not be a
Prohibited Person (such a person being hereinafter called an "Eligible Transferee"). On and
after the date of such Transfer Notice, and until registration of a transfer of the Prohibited
Shares to which it relates pursuantto the provisions referred to in this Article 9.1 or Article 9.2,
the rights and privileges attaching to the Prohibited Shares will be suspended and not capable
of exercise.

If within ten days after the. giving of a»Transfer Notice (or such extended time as in the
circumstances the Board consider reasonable) the Transfer Notice has not been complied
with to the satisfaction of the Board, the Company may sell the Prohibited Shares on behalf of
the holder thereof by instructing an approved relevant stock exchange member firm to sell
them at the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale to any one or more Eligible
Transferees. To give effect to a sale the Board may authorise in writing any officer or
employee or the Secretary to transfer the Prohibited Shares on behalf of the holder thereof (or
any person who is automatically entitled to the shares by transmission or by law) or to cause
the transfer of the Prohibited Shares.to the transferee and in relation to an uncertificated share
may require the operator to convert the share into certificated form and an instrument of
transfer executed by that person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the holder
of, or the person entitled by transmission to, the Prohibited Shares. The transferee is not
bound to see to the application of the purchase money and the title of the transferee is not
affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings connected to the sale. The net
proceeds of the sale of the Prohibited Shares, after payment of the Company's costs of the
sale, shall be paid by the Company to the Vendor or, if reasonable enquiries have failed to
establish the location of the Vendor, into a trust account at a bank designated by the
Company, the associated costs of which shall be borne by such trust account. The Company
may register or cause the registration of the transferee as holder of the Prohibited Shares and
thereupon the transferee shall become absolutely entitled thereto.

A person who becomes aware that he is, or is likely to be, a Prohibited Person, shall forthwith,
unless he has already received a Transfer Notice pursuant to the provisions referred to in this
Article 9 either transfer the shares to one or more Eligible Transferees or give a request in
writing to the Board for the issue of a Transfer Notice in accordance with the provisions
referred to in this Article 9. Every such request shall, in the case of certificated shares, be
accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates.

16
9.4

9.5

10.

10.1

10.2

10.3

Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the Board shall, unless any Director has reason to
believe otherwise, be entitled to assume without enquiry that none of the shares are held in
such a way as to entitle the Board to serve a Transfer Notice in respect thereof. The Board
may, however, at any time and from time to time call upon any holder (or any one of joint
holders or a person who is automatically entitled to the shares by transmission or by law) of
shares by notice in writing to provide such information and evidence as they require upon any
matter connected with or in relation to such holders of shares. In the event of such
information and evidence not being so provided within such reasonable period (not being less
than ten clear days after service of the notice requiring the same) as may be specified by the
Board in the said notice, the Board may, in its absolute discretion, treat any share held by
such a holder or joint holders or person who is automatically entitled to the shares by
transmission or by law as being held in such a way as to entitle them to service a Transfer
Notice in respect thereof.

The Board will not be required to give any reasons for any decision, determination or
declaration taken or made in accordance with these provisions. The exercise of the powers
conferred by the provisions referred to in Articles 9.1 to 9.4 may not be questioned or
invalidated in any case on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence of direct or indirect
beneficial ownership or holding of shares by any person or that the true direct or beneficial
owner or holder of any shares was otherwise than as appeared to the Board at the relevant
date provided that the said powers have been exercised in good faith.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

If a Shareholder dies, the Survivor(s), where the deceased was a joint holder, and his personal
representatives where he was:a sole.or the only surviving holder, shall be the only person or
persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his shares; but nothing in these
Articles shall release the estate of a deceased holder from.any liability in respect of any share
held by him solely or jointly.

A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a
Shareholder may, upon producing such evidence as the Directors may reasonably require,
elect either to become the registered holder of the share by giving notice to the Company to
that effect or have some other person registered as the transferee. If he elects to have some
other person registered he shall, in the case of a certificated share, execute an instrument of
transfer of such shares to that person and, in the case of an uncertificated share, either
procure that all appropriate instructions are given by means of the Relevant System to effect
the transfer of such share to such person or change the uncertificated to certificated form and
then execute an instrument of transfer of such share to such person. Any instrument of
transfer of the shares must be in accordance with the provisions of Article 8.

Any person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of a
Shareholder or of any other event giving rise to transmission shall be entitled to the same
dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder
of the share, except that he shall not, unless and until he is registered as a Shareholder in
respect of the share or unless the Directors otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of it to
receive notice of, or to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to, meetings of
the Company. The Directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect

17
12.1

12.2

12.3

either to be registered himself or to transfer such share to some other person and, if such
notice is not complied with within ninety days after service, the Directors may thereafter
withhold payment of all dividends and other moneys payable in respect of such share until the
requirements of the notice have been complied with.

ODD-LOT OFFERS

The Company shall be entitled to implement an odd-lot offer in accordance with the provisions
of this Article 11 in accordance with the restrictions and procedures imposed by the Relevant
Stock Exchange.

If, upon implementation of any odd-lot offer made by the Company, there are holders of
shares holding in aggregate less than 100 (one hundred) shares, or such other number of
shares as determined by the Relevant Stock Exchange as amounting to an odd-lot ("Odd-
Lots") in the Company ("Odd-Lot Holders"), then the Company shall, save in respect of Odd-
Lot Holders who have elected to retain their Odd-Lots in the Company —

11.2.1. cause the Odd-Lots to be expropriated. by the Company from the Odd-Lot Holders
who have not made an election to retain their. Odd-Lots in the Company or sold in
such manner as the Directors may direct; and

11.2.2 procure that the proceeds of such expropriation or sales are paid to such Oda-Lot
Holders.

All unclaimed proceeds of such sales (other than monetary proceeds) may be invested,
provided that all monies due to Shareholders must be held by the Company in trust. Subject
to the laws of prescription, proceeds of such sales which remain unclaimed for a period of 3
(three) years from the date on which they were declared (or such longer period as may be
required under the laws of prescription) may be declared forfeited by the Directors for the
benefit of the Company. The Directors may at any. time annul such forfeiture upon such
conditions (if any) as they think fit.

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The Directors may convene meetings of the Shareholders or any class of Shareholders for the
purposes of adhering to the rules and regulations applicable to the Relevant Stock Exchange
upon which the Company has its primary listing, at such times and in such manner and places
within or outside the British Virgin Islands as they consider appropriate.

Upon the written request of a Shareholder or Shareholders entitled to exercise fifteen per cent
or more of the Voting Rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested, the
Directors shall convene a meeting of Shareholders or class of Shareholders.

When convening a Shareholders’ meeting or a meeting of a class of Shareholders, the
following notice periods shall apply -

12.3.1. for such time as the Company is registered as an external company in South Africa,
and where a non-electronic notice of a Shareholders' meeting, or annual financial

18
12.4

12.5

12.6

12.7

12.8

12.9

statements, is to be distributed from the registered office of the Company, at least
twenty business days’ notice of such meeting must be given to all Shareholders
entitled to thereto. Where such notice, or annual financial statements, is distributed
electronically, by airmail or otherwise from the South African transfer secretaries, at
least fifteen business days’ notice of such meeting must be given to all Shareholders
entitled thereto.

where the Company has been deregistered as an external Company in South Africa, the
Directors shall give not less than fifteen business days’ notice of such meeting. Irrespective of
the manner in which notice of a meeting is given, either generally or to a specific shareholder,
no Shareholder shall be entitled to more than fifteen business days’ notice of any meeting.

Notice of every meeting of Shareholders shall be given to all Shareholders whose names on
the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the register of Shareholders and who
are entitled to vote at the meeting, and shall be released on SENS and provided to the
Relevant Exchange upon which the Company has a primary listing. Subject to the rules and
regulations applicable to the Relevant Stock Exchange/s upon which the Company has a
primary listing the Directors may fix, as the record date for determining those Shareholders
that are entitled to vote at the meeting, the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other
date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

The notice to Shareholders shall specify:
12.6.1 the place, the day and the time of the meeting;
12.6.2 the nature of the business to be considered; and

12.6.3 with reasonable prominence that a Shareholder entitled to attend and vote is entitled
to appoint a proxy to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of him, and that a proxy need
not be a Shareholder.

A meeting of Shareholders or a class of Shareholders held in contravention of the notice
requirement pursuant to Article 12.3, is valid:ifa Shareholder or Shareholders holding at least
ninety per cent of the total Voting Rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting
have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the
meeting shall constitute a waiver in relation to all the shares which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure of the Directors to give notice of a meeting to a Shareholder or the fact
that a Shareholder has not received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders or a class of Shareholders
by a proxy who may speak and vote on behalf of the Shareholder. Deposit of an instrument of
proxy shall not preclude a Shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting in
respect of which the proxy is appointed or at any adjournment of it.

12.10 The appointment of a proxy shall unless the contrary is stated in it be valid as well for any

adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates and where it is stated to
apply to more than one meeting, be valid for all such meetings as well as for any adjournment
of any such meetings.

19
12.11 The appointment of a proxy, shall:

12.11.1 in the case of an instrument in writing not contained in an electronic communication,
be delivered to the registered office or South African transfer secretaries (or such
other address or location as may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note to
the notice convening the meeting) not less than forty-eight hours before the time fixed
for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the
instrument is authorised to vote;

of election may be exercised.

The Directors, after determining the maximum number of shares of the Company to

additional shares of the Company determined as aforesaid and for such purpose the
Directors shall appropriate and capitalise out of any reserve or fund as they shall
determine an amount equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the additional shares
to be so allotted and apply the same in paying up in full the appropriate number of
unissued shares for allotment and distribution to and amongst those Shareholders

and with all other fully paid shares in issue on the record date for the distribution in
respect of which the right of election has been offered except that they will not rank
for any dividend or other distribution or other entitlement (including the relevant
distribution and the share election in lieu of such distribution) which has been

they think fit. Such reserve fund may be applied for the purpose of maintaining the property of
the Company, replacing wasting assets, meeting contingencies, forming an insurance fund,
equalising dividends, paying special dividends or bonuses, or for any other purpose for which
the profits of the Company may lawfully be used. The Directors may divide the reserve fund
into such special funds as it thinks fit and may consolidate into one fund any special fund or
any part of any special fund into which the reserve fund may have been divided, as it thinks fit.

profit or balance of profits which they shall not think fit to distribute or to place to reserve.

capitalise any part of the amount for the time being standing to the credit of any of the
Company's reserve funds, reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss

42
account (not being required for the payment of or provision for any fixed preferential
dividend), and accordingly that such sum be applied:

(a) on behalf of the Shareholders who would have been entitled thereto if distributed
by way of dividend and in the same proportion either in or towards paying up any
amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares held by such Shareholders
respectively or paying up in full unissued shares or debentures of the Company
to be allotted and issued credited as fully paid up to and among such
Shareholders in the proportion aforesaid or partly in the one way and partly in the
other; or

(6) otherwise as the Directors may resolve.

26.11.2 Whenever such a resolution shall have been passed, the Directors may do all acts
and things considered necessary or expedient to give effect to any such
capitalisation. The Directors may authorise any person to enter, on behalf of all the
Shareholders interested, into an agreement with the Company providing for such
capitalisation and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made under such
authority shall be effective and binding.on all concerned.

26.11.3 Subject to the Act, the following provisions of this Article 26 (which are without
prejudice to the generality of the provisions of Article 26.11.1) apply:

(a) where a person is granted pursuant to an employees’ share scheme a right to
subscribe for shares in the Company in cash at a subscription price less than
their nominal-value; or

(6) where, pursuant to an employees’ share scheme, the terms on which any person
is entitled to subscribe in cash for shares in the Company are adjusted as a result
of a capitalisation issue, rights issue or other variation of capital so that the
subscription price is less than their nominal value,

in any such case the Directors:

(c) may transfer to a reserve account a sum equal to the deficiency between the
subscription price and the nominal value of the shares (the "cash deficiency")
from the profits or reserves of the Company which are available for distribution
and not required for the payment of any preferential dividend; and

(d) subject to Article 26.13, if such transfer is made, shall not apply that reserve
account for any purpose other than paying up the cash deficiency upon the
allotment of those shares.

26.12 Whenever the Company is required to allot shares pursuant to such a right to subscribe, the
Directors may (subject to the Act) appropriate to capital out of the reserve account an amount
equal to the cash deficiency applicable to those shares, apply that amount in paying up the
deficiency on the nominal value of those shares and allot those shares credited as fully paid to
the person entitled to them.

43
26.13 If any person ceases to be entitled to subscribe for shares as described above, the restrictions

on the reserve account shall cease to apply in relation to such part of the account as is equal
to the amount of the cash deficiency applicable to those shares.

26.14 No right shall be granted under any employees' share scheme under Article 26.11.3(a) and no

27.

27.1

27.2

27.4

adjustment shall be made as mentioned in Article 26.11.3(b) unless there are sufficient profits

of an amount sufficient to pay up the cash deficiency applicable to the shares concerned.
