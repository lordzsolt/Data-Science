security into, such number of Shares not exceeding in aggregate 100 per
cent of the total number of Shares in issue immediately following Admission.

Pre-emption rights

(a)

Unless otherwise agreed by a Resolution of.Shareholders passed by a 75 per cent
majority or specifically provided for otherwise in these Articles, the Company must not
allot any Equity..Securities to.any person unless.it has first offered them to all
Shareholders on the date of the offer, on the same ierms and at the same price as those
Equity Securities are proposed to be offered to other persons, equally and in proportion to
the number of Shares held by those holders (as nearly as possible without involving
fractions). The offer:

(i) must be in writing and remain open for acceptance for a period of 15
Business Days from the date of the offer and must give details of the number
and subscription price of ihe relevant Equity Securities; and

(ii) may stipulate that any shareholder who wishes to subscribe for a number of
Equity Securities in excess of the proportion to which he is entitled must, in
his acceptance, state the number of excess Equity Securities for which he
wishes to subscribe.

Any Equity Securities not accepted by shareholders pursuant to the offer made to
them in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above will be used for satisfying any
requests for excess equity securities made pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above. If
there are insufficient excess Equity Securities to satisfy such requests, they will be
allotted to the applicants in proportion to the number of Shares held by the applicants
immediately before the offer was made to the shareholders (as nearly as possible
without involving fractions or increasing the number of excess Equity Securities
allotted to any shareholder beyond that applied for by him). After that allotment, any
excess Equity Securities remaining will be offered to any other person as the
Directors may determine, at the same price and on the same terms as the offer to the
Shareholders.

The pre-emption provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply in the
following circumstances:

(i) the issue of Equity Securities if these are to be paid for otherwise than wholly
in cash;
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

(ii) share options granted pursuant to any option scheme adopted by the Company
from time to time over equity securities equivalent to up to a maximum of 10 per
cent of the total number of issued Shares from time to time;

(iii) an issue of bonus shares;
(iv) any Shares or warrants issued in connection with Admission; or
(v) the issue of such number of Equity Securities not exceeding 50 per cent of the

total number of Shares in issue immediately following Admission.
(d) Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.

(e) The Directors are authorised to amend this Article 9 to the extent necessary to
comply with any statutory or regulatory requirements relating to rights issues.

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note,
or other written obligation to contribute money or property, real property, personal
property (including goodwill and know-how), services rendered or a contract for future
services.

No Shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of
Directors has been passed stating:

(a) the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares;

(b) the determination of the Directors.of the reasonable present cash value of the non-
money consideration for the issue; and

(c) that, in the opinion of the Directors, the present.cash value of the non-money
consideration for the issue is not less than the amount to be credited for the issue of
the Shares.

The Company shall keep a Register of Members containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the Eligible Persons who hold Shares;
(b) the number of each Class and Series of Shares held by each Shareholder;
(c) the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the Register of

Members; and
(d) the date on which any Eligible Person ceased to be a Shareholder.

The Register of Members may be in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in
magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible
evidence of its contents. Until the Directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or
other data storage form shall be the original Register of Members.

A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the Register
of Members.

Nothing in these Articles shall require title to any Shares or other securities of the Company to
be evidenced by a certificate if the Act and the rules of the Stock Exchange permit otherwise.

Subject to the Act and the rules of the Stock Exchange, the Board without further consultation
with the holders of any Shares or securities of the Company may resolve that any Class or
Series of Shares or other securities of the Company from time to time in issue or to be issued
(including Shares in issue at the date of the adoption of these Articles) may be issued, held,
registered, converted to transferred, or otherwise dealt with in uncertificated form in

10
17.

18.

19.

20.

21.

22.

accordance with the Securities Regulations and practices instituted by the operator of the
relevant system and no provision of these Articles will apply to any uncertificated Share or
other securities of the Company to the extent that they are inconsistent with the holding of
such Shares or other securities in uncertificated form or the transfer of title to any such
Shares or other securities by means of a relevant system or any provision of the
Securities Regulations.

Conversion of Shares held in certificated form into Shares held in, uncertificated form, and
vice versa, may be made in such manner as the Board may in its absolute discretion, thinks fit
(subject always to the Securities Regulations and the requirements of the relevant system
concerned). The Company shall enter on the Register of Members how many Share are held
by each Shareholder in uncertificated form and in certificated form and shall maintain the
Register of Members in each case as is required by the Securities Regulations and the
relevant system concerned. Notwithstanding any provision of these Articles, a Class or Series
of Shares shall not be treated as two Classes by virtue only of that Class or Series comprising
both certificated Shares and uncertificated Shares or as a result of any provision of these
Articles or the Securities Regulations which apply only in respect of certificated or
uncertificated Shares.

Whenever as the result of any consolidation, division or sub-division of Shares any member
would become entitled to fractions of a Share, the Board may deal with the fractions as it
thinks fit and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) the Board
may determine which of the Shares of.such.holder are to be treated as giving rise to such
fractional entitlement and may decide that any of those Shares shall be consolidated with any
of the Shares of any other holder or holders which are similarly determined by it to be treated
as giving rise to a fractional entitlement for such other holder or holders into a single
consolidated Share and the Board may on behalf of all such holders, sell such consolidated
Share for the best price reasonably obtained to any person (including the Company) and
distribute the net proceeds of sale after deduction of the expenses of sale in due proportion
among those holders (except that any amount otherwise due to a holder, being less than £3
or such other sum as the Board may from time to time determine may be retained for the
benefit of the Company).

For the purposes of any sale of consolidated Shares pursuant to Article 18, the Board may in
the case of certificated Shares authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of
the Shares to or in accordance with the directions of the purchaser or in the case of
uncertificated Shares take such steps (Subject to the Securities Regulations and the rules and
practices of the relevant system concerned).as may be required or appropriate to effect such
disposal, and the transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase
money in respect of any such sale, nor shall his title to the Shares be affected by any
irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale or transfer and any
instrument or exercise shall be effective as if it had been executed or exercised by the holder
of the fractional entitlement to which it relates.

If a share certificate for certificated Shares is defaced, worn out, lost or destroyed it may be
replaced without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and to payment
of any exceptional out-of-pocket expenses of the Company in investigating such evidence
and preparing such indemnity as the Board may think fit and, in case of defacement or
wearing out, on delivery up of the old certificate to the Company.

All forms of certificate for Share or loan capital or other securities of the Company (other than
letters of allotment, scrip certificates and other like documents) shall be issued under the Seal
or in such other manner as the Board may authorise. The Board may by Resolution of
Directors determine, either generally or in any particular case or cases, that any signatures on
any such certificate need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificate by some
mechanical or electronic means or may be printed thereon or that such certificate need not be
signed by any person.

Any Shareholder receiving a share certificate for certificated Shares shall indemnify and hold
the Company and its Directors and Officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they

by virtue of the possession thereof.

the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the

Articles to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.

be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

The Board may decline to register a transfer of any Share to a person known to be a minor,
bankrupt or person who is mentally disordered or a patient for the purpose of any statute
relating to mental health.

The Board may also decline to register any transfer of Shares unless:

(a) any written instrument of transfer, duly stamped (if so required), is lodged with the
Company at the Registered Office or such other place as the Board may appoint
accompanied by the certificate for the Shares to which it relates (except in the case of
a transfer by a recognised person or a holder of such Shares in respect of whom the
Company is not required by law to deliver a certificate and to whom a certificate has
not been issued in respect of such Shares);

(b) any instrument of transfer is in respect of only one Class or Series of Share; and

(c) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the
Share is to be transferred does not exceed four.

The Company may retain an instrument of transfer which is registered but a transfer which
the Directors refuse to register shall (except in the case of known or suspected fraud) be
returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is given.

If the Board declines to register a transferst-shall, within two months or such other period (if

incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the
document evidencing the grant of probate letters of administration, confirmation as executor,

competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign
court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the Directors may obtain appropriate legal
advice. The Directors may also require an indemnity to be given by the executor,
administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be

required by the Directors and in the case of uncertificated Shares subject also to the facilities
and requirements of the relevant system concerned. An application by any such person to be
registered as a Shareholder shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the
deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and the Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of the death,
incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may, instead of being registered himself,

court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

An Annual General Meeting of the Company shall be held in each year in addition to any
other meetings which may be held in that year, and such meeting shall be specified as the
Annual General Meeting in the notices calling it. Not more than 15 months shall elapse
between the date of one Annual General Meeting and the date of the next.

The Directors of the Company may, by a Resolution of Directors, convene meetings of the
Shareholders at such times and in such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin
Islands as the Director considers necessary or desirable.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 10 per cent or more of the
voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the Directors shall
convene a meeting of Shareholders.

The Directors convening a meeting shall give not less than 21 clear days' notice of an Annual
General Meeting and 14 clear days' notice of all other meetings of Shareholders to those
Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as Shareholders in the
Register of Members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting.

The Directors convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for
determining those Shareholders that.are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is
given of the meeting, or such.other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not
earlier than the date of notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90 per cent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be
considered at the meeting have waived»notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the
presence of a Shareholder at the meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares
which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure of a Director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a
Shareholder or another Director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another Director has not
received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak
and vote on behalf of the Shareholder. A proxy need not be a Shareholder. A Shareholder
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a meeting provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different Share or Shares held by him.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall, subject to Article 64, be in writing under the hand of
the appointor or of his attorney authorised in writing or, if the appointor is a corporation, either
under its seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person duly authorised to sign
the same.

The Board may allow an appointment of proxy to be sent or supplied in electronic form
subject to any conditions or limitations as the Board may specify.

The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Board) the power of attorney or
other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such power or authority,
shall be sent or supplied in hard copy form, or (Subject to any conditions and limitations which
the Directors may specify) in electronic form, to the registered office of the Company or such
other address (including electronic address) as is specified in:

(a) the notice convening the meeting;

(b) any instrument of proxy sent out by the Company in relation to the meeting; or
15
63.

64.

65.

66.

67.

68.

(c) any invitation to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation to the meeting,

to be received at such address not less than forty-eight hours before the time appointed for
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the instrument
proposes to vote or:

(i) in the case of a poll taken more than forty-eight hours after it was demanded,
be delivered at the registered office (or other specified place) not less than
twenty-four hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll; or

(ii) where the poll is not taken forthwith but is taken not more than forty-eight
hours after it was demanded, be delivered at the meeting at which the poll
was demanded to the Chairman or to the company secretary (if any) or to
any Director and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as
valid.

No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of twelve months from the
date named in it as the date of its execution. If two or more valid but differing instruments are
delivered in respect of the same Share for use at the same meeting, the one which is last to
be delivered shall be treated as replacing the others in respect of that Share. If the Directors
cannot readily determine to their satisfaction which was the last to be delivered, they may, in
their absolute discretion, determine that any one or none of them shall be treated as valid in
respect of the Share.

Instruments of proxy shall be in any common, form or in such other form as the Board may
approve and the Board may, ‘if,it thinks fit, send. out with the notice of any meeting (or
separately) physical and/or electronic forms of instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The
instrument of proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll
and to vote on any amendment of any resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the
proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as
well for any adjournment of the meeting as-for the meeting to. which it relates.

A vote or poll demanded by proxy or by the duly authorised representative of a corporation
given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid notwithstanding
the previous death or incapacity of the principal, or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of
the authority under which it was executed, provided that no intimation in writing of such death,
incapacity or revocation shall have been received by the Company at the registered office (or
such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy in the notice
convening the meeting or other document sent therewith) three hours at least before the
commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise
than on the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the taking of the poll, at which
the instrument of proxy is used.

The following applies where Shares are jointly owned:

(a) if two or more persons hold Shares jointly each of them may be present in person or
by proxy at a meeting of Shareholders and may speak as a Shareholder;

(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf
of all joint owners; and

(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as
one.

A Shareholder shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of Shareholders if he participates
by telephone or other electronic means and all Shareholders participating in the meeting are
able to hear each other.

A meeting of Shareholders is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there
are present in person or by proxy Shareholders holding not less than two Shares entitled to

vote on Resolutions of Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may
comprise a single Shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a Resolution of
Shareholders and a certificate signed by such person accompanied where such person be a
proxy by a copy of the proxy instrument shall constitute a valid Resolution of Shareholders.

If within 15 minutes from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the
meeting, if convened upon the requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved; in any other
case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day in the jurisdiction in which the meeting
was to have been held at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the
Directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting there are present within one hour
from the time appointed for the meeting in person or by proxy not less than one third of the
votes of the Shares or each Class or Series of Shares entitled to vote on the matters to be
considered by the meeting, those present shall constitute a quorum but otherwise the meeting
shall be dissolved.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the
meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present at
the meeting, the Shareholders present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman. If
the Shareholders are unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person
representing the greatest number of voting Shares present in person or by proxy at the
meeting shall preside as chairman failing which the oldest individual Shareholder or
representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting; adjourn any meeting from time to time,
and from place to place, but no business: shall.be transacted at any adjourned meeting other
than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner
as he considers appropriate whether any resolution proposed has been carried or not and the
result of his decision shall be announced to. the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the
meeting. If the chairman has any doubi.as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed
resolution, he shall cause a poll to. be taken of all votes cast upon such resolution. If the
chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present in person or by proxy who disputes
the announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may immediately following such
announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken. If
a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in
the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Article for the appointment of
representatives of Eligible Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak
for or represent a Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by
the documents by which, the Eligible Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of
doubt, the Directors may in good faith seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless
and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the Directors may rely and act
upon such advice without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the Company.

Any Eligible Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its
Directors or other governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its
representative at any meeting of Shareholders or of any Class of Shareholders, and the
individual so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same rights on behalf of the
Shareholder which he represents as that Shareholder could exercise if it were an individual.

The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Eligible
Persons other than an individual may call for a notarially certified copy of such proxy or
authority which shall be produced within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by
such proxy or on behalf of such Eligible Person shall be disregarded.

Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any
separate meeting of the holder of any Class or Series of Shares.

An action that may be taken by the Shareholders at a meeting may also be taken by a
resolution consented to in writing, without the need for any notice, but if any Resolution of
Shareholders is adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all
Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not
consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the form of counterparts, each
counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect
on the earliest date upon which Shareholders holding a sufficient number of votes of Shares
to constitute a Resolution of Shareholders have consented to the resolution by signed
counterparts.

The first Directors of the Company shall be appointed by the first Registered Agent within 6
months of the date of incorporation of the Company; and thereafter, the Directors shall be

such meeting. The Directors may, but are not required, to call a meeting of Shareholders to fill
a vacancy.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

A Director, including an alternate Director;;may hold any other office or place of profit under
the Company, other than the office of auditor, in conjunction with his office of Director and
may act in a professional capacity to the Company, on such terms as to tenure of office,
remuneration and otherwise as the Board may determine.

Subject to the provisions of these Articles, no Director, including an alternate Director, is
disqualified by his office from contracting with the Company either with regard to his tenure or
any other office or place of profit, or as seller, purchaser or otherwise. No such contract, or
any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any
Director is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested, is liable to be avoided, nor is
any Director so contracting or being so interested obliged to account to the Company for any
profit realised by any such contract or arrangement by reason of the Director holding that
office or of his fiduciary relationship with the Company.

Any Director, including an alternate Director; may continue to be or become a director or other
officer or member of or otherwise interested in any other company promoted by the Company
or in which the Company may be interested, as a member or otherwise, or which is a holding
company of the Company or a subsidiary of any such holding company. No such Director is
accountable for any remuneration or other benefits received by him as a director or other
officer or member of, or from his interest in, any such other company. The Board may
exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any other company held or owned by the
Company, or exercisable by the directors of such other company, in such manner in all
respects as they think fit, subject to the restrictions contained in Article 141.

A Director, including an alternate Director, who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly,
interested in a contract, transaction or arrangement or proposed contract, transaction or
arrangement, with the Company must declare the nature of his interest at a meeting of the
Board. In the case of a proposed contract, transaction or arrangement, the declaration must
be made at the meeting of the Board at which the question of entering into the contract,
transaction or arrangement is first taken into consideration or, if the Director was not at the
date of that meeting interested in the proposed contract, transaction or arrangement, at the
next meeting of the Board held after he became so interested. In a case where the Director
becomes interested in a contract, transaction or arrangement after it is made, the declaration
must be made at the first meeting of the Board held after the Director becomes so interested.
In a case where the Director is interested in a contract, transaction or arrangement which has
been made before he was appointed a Director, the declaration must be made at the first
meeting of the Board held after he is so appointed.

effect that he is a member of any specified company or firm and is to be regarded as
interested in any contract which may, after the date of the notice, be made with such
company or firm is deemed a sufficient declaration of interest in relation to any contract so
made if such Director gives the notice at a meeting of the Board or takes reasonable steps to
secure that it is brought up and read at the next meeting of the Board after it is given.

A Director may continue or become a director or other officer, employee or member of any
company promoted by the Company or in which it may be interested as a seller, shareholder,
or otherwise, and no such Director is accountable for any remuneration or other benefits
derived as director or other officer, employee or member of such company.

transaction entered into or to be entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to all
other Directors except if the relevant transaction is between the Director and the Company
and is (or is to be) entered into in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length
basis.

For the purposes of Article 136, a disclosure to all other Directors to the effect that a Director
is a member, director or officer of another named entity or has a fiduciary relationship with
respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be regarded as interested in any
transaction which may, after the date of the entry or disclosure, be entered into with that entity
or individual, is a sufficient disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.

company, any such interest being deemed for the purpose of this Article to be a
material interest in all circumstances;

(e) any contract, arrangement, transaction or other proposal concerning the adoption,
modification or operation of a superannuation fund or retirement, death or disability
benefits scheme under which he may benefit;

varying the terms of appointment, of two or more Directors to offices or employments with the
Company or any company in which the Company is interested, such proposals may be
divided and considered in-relation to each_Director separately. In such cases, each of the
Directors concerned, if not debarred from voting under Article 138(b) is entitled to vote and be
counted in the quorum in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own
appointment.

If any question arises at any meeting as to the materiality of a Director’s interest or as to the
entittement of any Director to vote and such question is not resolved by his voluntarily
agreeing to abstain from voting, such question must be referred to the chairman of the
meeting and his ruling in relationto any other Director will be final and conclusive, except in a
case where the nature or extent of the interests of the Director concerned have not been fairly
disclosed. If the question concerns the chairman, it'must be referred to such other Director
present at the meeting, other than the chairman, as the Directors present appoint.

The Company may by a Resolution of Shareholders suspend or relax the provisions of
Articles 133 to 143 to any extent or ratify any transaction not duly authorised by reason of a
contravention of these Articles.

such Shareholder at his registered address or in accordance with the procedure set out in
Article 182.

Where a notice or other document is served or sent by post, service or delivery shall be deemed to
be effected at the expiration of twenty-four hours (or, where second-class mail is employed, forty-
eight hours) after the time when the cover containing the same is posted and in proving such
service or delivery it shall be sufficient to prove that such cover was properly addressed, stamped
and posted.

The Company is generally and unconditionally authorised to use electronic communications
with its Shareholders and in particular to send or supply documents or information to its
Shareholders by making them available on a website. Accordingly, the Company may give or
send to any Shareholders any notice or other document (excluding a share certificate) by
electronic communication where:

(a) the Company and that Shareholder have agreed to the use of electronic communication
for sending copies.of documenis to the Shareholder and:

(i) the documents are documents to which the agreement applies; and

(ii) copies of the documents are sent using electronic communication to such
address. (or to one of such.addresses if more than one) as may for the time
being be notified by the Shareholder to the Company for that purpose; or

(b) the Company and that Shareholder have agreed to that Shareholder having access to
documents on a website (instead of the documents being sent to him) and:

(i) the documents are documents to which the agreement applies; and

(ii) the text and images in the documents can be (as appropriate) read or seen
using the naked eye; and

(iii) the Shareholder is notified in a manner for the time being agreed for the
purpose between the Shareholder and the Company of:

(A) the presence of the documents on a website;
(B) the address of that website;

(C) the place on that website where the documents may be accessed
and how they may be accessed; and

(D) the period of time for which the documents will be available on the
website is for a period of not less than twenty-eight days from the
date of notification or, if later, until the conclusion of any General
Meeting to which the documents relate; and

(iv) the documents are published on that website throughout the period referred
to in Article 182(b)(iii)(D) above, provided that, if the documents are
published on that website for a part but not all of such period, the documents
will be treated as published throughout that period if the failure to publish

may send a notice or other document in accordance with Article 182.

Where a notice or other document is given or sent by electronic communication, it shall be
deemed to have been given or sent at the expiration of two hours from the time it was sent to
an address supplied by the Shareholder or of notification to the Shareholder of its publication
on a website or, if later, from the time it was so published after the notification. Proof that a

the share register as it stands at any time not more than 15 days before the date of service or
delivery (or such shorter period as the Directors may determine by Resolution of Directors),
no change in the share register after that time shall invalidate the service or delivery.

Shares to which a person is entitled by virtue of transmission on death or bankruptcy or

net proceeds of sale shall belong to the Company which shall be obliged to account to the
former Shareholder or other person previously entitled as aforesaid for an amount equal to
such proceeds and shall enter the name of such former Shareholder or other person in the
books of the Company as a creditor for such amount which shall be a permanent debt of the
Company. No trust shall be created in respect of the debt, no interest shall be payable in
respect of the same and the Company shall not be required to account for any money earned

TAKEOVER PROVISIONS
Except with the consent of the Board or a majority of the Independent Shareholders, when:

(a) any person (other than the Depository in its capacity as such) acquires, whether by a
series of transactions over a period of time or not, Shares which (taken together
with Shares held or acquired by persons acting in concert with him) carry 30 per
cent or more of the voting rights of the Company; or

(b) any person (other than the Depository in its capacity as such) who, together with
persons acting in concert with him, holds not less than 30 per cent but not more
than 50 per cent of the voting rights and such person, or any person acting in
concert with him, acquires additional Shares which increase his percentage of the
voting rights.

such person ("the offeror") shall extend an offer, on the basis set out in these Articles, to the
holders of all the issued Shares in. the»sCompany. For the purposes of this Article 190,
"Independent Shareholders" means the Shareholders, other than any Shareholder who
would otherwise be required to. make a mandatory takeover offer under this Article 190, or any
person acting in concert with such Shareholder (for the.avoidance of doubt, any Shareholder
selling Shares in such, transaction shall.be considered to be an Independent Shareholder
entitled to vote on the resolution).

Any offer made under Article 190 must be conditional only upon the offeror having received
acceptances in respect of Shares which; together with Shares acquired or agreed to be
acquired before or during the offer, will result in the offeror and any person acting in concert
with it holding Shares carrying more than 50 per cent of the voting rights.

No acquisition of Shares which would give rise to a requirement for any offer under Article
190 may be made or registered if the making or implementation of such offer would or might
be dependent on the passing of.a resolution at.any meeting of the Shareholders of the
Company or upon any other conditions, consents or arrangements.

Offers made under Article 190 must, in respect of each Class of Share capital involved, be
in cash or be accompanied by a cash alternative at not less than the highest price paid by the
offeror or any person acting in concert with it for Shares of that Class during the offer period
and within 12 months prior to its commencement. The cash offer or the cash alternative must
remain open after the offer has become or is declared unconditional as to acceptances for not
less than 14 days after the date on which it would otherwise have expired.

No nominee of an offeror or persons acting in concert with it may be appointed as a
Director, nor may an offeror and persons acting in concert with it exercise the votes attaching
to any Shares held in the Company until the offer document has been posted.

Any offer required to be made pursuant to these Articles shall be made on terms that
would be required by the then current United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers
("the City Code"), as may from time to time be published by the United Kingdom Panel on
Takeovers and Mergers ("the Panel"), save to the extent that the Board otherwise
determines. In relation to any offer required to be made pursuant to these Articles, any matter
which under the City Code would fall to be determined by the Panel shall be determined by
the Board in its absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to make such
determination.

Except with the consent of the Board, Shareholders shall comply with the requirements of
the City Code, in relation to any dealings in any Shares of the Company and in relation to
their dealings with the Company in relation to all matters. Any matter which under the City
Code would fall to be determined by the Panel shall be determined by the Board in its
absolute discretion or by such person appointed by the Board to make such determination.

Any notice which under the City Code is required to be given to the Panel or any person
(other than the Company) shall be given to the Company at its Registered Office.

In exercising any discretion conferred by Articles 194 and 195,

(a) the Board or such other person (as the case may be) shall consider all guidance and
statements issued by the Panel; and

(b) no infringement shall be made of the general principle that all holders of the securities
of an offeree company of the same class must be afforded equivalent treatment.

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Shareholder having incurred an obligation
under these Articles to extend an offer to the holders of all the issued Shares shall have failed
so to do, or that any Shareholders is in default of any other obligation imposed upon
Shareholders pursuant to these Articles, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at any
time thereafter by notice (a "direction notice") to such Shareholders and any other
Shareholders acting in concert with such Shareholders (together "the defaulters") direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares held.by the defaulters (the "default shares") the defaulters
shall not be entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by proxy or to
exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the
Company;

(b) except in a liquidation of the Company, no payment shall be made of any sums due
from the Company on the default shares, whether in respect of capital or dividend or
otherwise, and the Company shall not meet any_liability to pay interest on any such
payment when it is finally paid to the Shareholders;

(c) no other distribution shall be made on the default shares.
The Board may at any time give notice cancelling a ‘direction notice.

City Code shall bear the same meanings given by the City Code.

DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST IN SHARES AND FAILURE TO DISCLOSE

Subject to any requirement under the Act, the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules which relate to the requirement of persons to disclose their interests in
Shares, shall apply to the Company as if its Home State (as defined in such rules) was the
United Kingdom and such rules shall be deemed to be incorporated into these Articles and
shall bind the Company and the Shareholders (other than the Depository).

Subject to any requirement under the Act, the provisions of section 793 of the UK CA 2006
shall be deemed to be incorporated into these Articles and shall bind the Company and the
Shareholders and references in such section to "a public company" shall be deemed to be
references to the Company.

Where notice is served by the Company under section 793 of the UK CA 2006 (a "section
793 notice") on a Shareholder, or another person whom the Company knows or has
reasonable cause to believe to be interested in Shares held by that Shareholder, and the
Shareholder or other person has failed in relation to any Shares (the "default shares", which
expression includes any Shares issued to such Shareholder after the date of the section 793
notice in respect of those Shares) to give the Company the information required within 14

34
204.

205.

206.

days following the date of service of the section 793 notice, the Board may serve on the
holder of such default shares a notice (a "disenfranchisement notice") whereupon the
following sanctions apply, unless the Board otherwise decides:

(a) the Shareholder shall not be entitled in respect of the default shares to be present or
to vote (either in person or by proxy) at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of
the holders of a Class of Shares or on a poll or to exercise other rights conferred by
membership in relation to the meeting or poll; and

(b) where the default shares represent at least 0.25 per cent in nominal value of the
issued Shares of their Class (calculated exclusive of any shares held as Treasury
Shares):

(i) a dividend (or any part of a dividend) or other amount payable in respect of
the default shares shall be withheld by the Company, which has no obligation
to pay interest on it; and

(ii) no transfer of any of the default shares shall be registered unless:
(A) the transfer is an excepted transfer; or
(B) the Shareholder is not himself in default in supplying the information

required and the Shareholder proves to the satisfaction of the Board
that no person in default in. supplying the information required is
interested in any of the Shares the subject of the transfer; or

(C) registration of the transfer is required by any Relevant System,

(and, for the purpose of ensuring this Article can apply to all Shares held by the
holder, the Company may, in accordance with the regulations of any Relevant
System, issue written notification to the operator of the Relevant System requiring the
conversion into certificated form of any Shares.held by the holder in uncertificated
form).

REMOVAL OF SANCTIONS

The sanctions under Article 203,shall cease to apply seven days after the receipt by the
Company of:

(a) notice of registration of an excepted transfer in relation to the default shares the
subject of the excepted transfer; and

(b) all information required by the section 793 notice, in a form satisfactory to the Board,
in relation to any default shares.

NOTICE TO PERSON OTHER THAN A SHAREHOLDER

Where, on the basis of information obtained from a Shareholder in respect of a Share held by
him, the Company issues a section 793 notice to another person, it shall at the same time
send a copy of the section 793 notice to the Shareholder, but the accidental omission to do
so, or the non-receipt by the Shareholder of the copy, does not invalidate or otherwise affect
the application of Article 202.

INTEREST IN SHARES, FAILURE TO GIVE INFORMATION AND EXCEPTED TRANSFERS

For the purpose of Articles 201 to 205:

(a) "interested" has the same meaning as in Part 22 of the UK CA 2006;

207.

(b) reference to a person having failed to give the Company the information required by a
section 793 notice, or being in default in supplying such information, includes:

(i) reference to his having failed or refused to give all or any part of it; and

(ii) reference to his having given information which he knows to be false in a
material particular or having recklessly given information which is false in a
material particular; and

(c) "excepted transfer" means, in relation to Shares held by a Shareholder:

(i) a transfer pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer for the Company (within
the meaning of section 974 of the UK CA 2006); or

(ii) a transfer where the Directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant
to a bona fide sale of the whole of the beneficial ownership of the Shares to a
party unconnected with the member or with any person appearing to be
interested in such Shares including any such sale made through a
recognised investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) (being a statute in force in the UK as may be amended or
re-enacted from time to time) or another stock exchange outside the United
Kingdom on which Shares in the capital of the Company are normally traded.
For the purposes of this sub-paragraph any associate (as that term is defined
in Section 435.of the UK Insolvency Act 1986) shall be included amongst the
persons who are connecied with the member or any person appearing to be
interested in such Shares.

Articles 201 to 206 are in addition to and without prejudice tothe Act.
