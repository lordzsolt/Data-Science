MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Any director of the Company may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in such

respect of the matter for which.the meeting is requested the directors shall convene a meeting of
Shareholders.

The director convening a meeting shall give not less than 7 days” notice of a meeting of Shareholders to:

register of members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting; and

Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting, or such other
date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if Shareholders
holding at least 90 percent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be considered at the meeting
have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the presence of a Shareholder at the meeting
shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares which that Shareholder holds.

or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not received notice, does not
invalidate the meeting.

behalf of the Shareholder.

time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The notice

POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of,
the directors of the Company. The directors of the Company have all the powers necessary for
managing, and for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The directors may
pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the Company and
may exercise all such powers of the Company as are not by the Act or by the Memorandum or the
Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.

Each director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company
acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each director, in
exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the director
believes to be the best interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company may,
when exercising powers or performing duties as a director, act in a manner which he believes is in the
best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

Any director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised representative
for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the directors, with respect to the signing of consents or
otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and:to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of
the Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all receipts
for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed, as the
case may be, in such manner as shall from time to:time be determined by Resolution of Directors.

For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the directors may by Resolution of
Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition is in the usual or regular
course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of fraud,
conclusive.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to each
other director.

The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and
places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary or
desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or other
electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of directors
held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors entitled to
vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a
director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a
meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the
meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and the alternate
shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed him and to vote in place
of the director until the appointment lapses or is terminated.

apply and such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not
by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu of
minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence
of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of
the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the
directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken
by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors consented to in writing by all
directors or by all members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The
consent may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the
consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall
take effect on the date upon which the last director has consented to the resolution by signed
counterparts.

Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from
appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

believe that his conduct was unlawful.
