manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each director, in exercising his powers or
performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the director believes to be the best interests of
the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a director of the Company may, when
exercising powers or performing duties as a director, act in a manner which he believes is in the best interests of
the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Any one director of the Company may call a meeting of the directors by sending a written notice to each other
director.

The directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner and places
within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the directors may determine to be necessary or desirable.

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or other electronic
means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a meeting of directors held
without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be valid if all the directors entitled to vote at the
meeting waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute
waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director
has not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director of the Company may appoint any other director or any other person, not disqualified from an
appointment as a director, as his alternate to exercise the appointing director’s powers and carry out the appointing
director’s responsibilities.

(a) An alternate director has the same rights as the appointing director in relation to any director’s meeting
and any written resolution circulated for written consent.

(b) Subject to the Act and Regulation 17, an alternate director is liable for his own acts and omission as an
alternate director whilst acting in that capacity.

(c) The appointment and termination of an alternate director must be in writing and written notice of the
appointment and termination must be given by the appointing director to the Company as soon as
reasonably practicable.

(d) The appointing director may, at any time, voluntarily terminate the alternate director’s appointment which
shall take effect from the time when the written notice of this termination is given to the Company.

(e) The rights of an alternate director shall terminate upon the death of the appointing director or if the
appointing director, otherwise ceases to hold office.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there are present
in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the total number of directors, unless there are only 2 directors in
which case the quorum is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of directors do not apply and
such sole director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not by the Act, the
Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting the
sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a resolution of
directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the chairman of the board is present, he shall preside as chairman of the meeting.
If there is no chairman of the board or if the chairman of the board is not present, the directors present shall choose
one of their numbers to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may also be taken by a
resolution of directors or a resolution of a committee of directors consented to in writing or by telex, telegram,
cable or other written electronic communication, without the need for any notice by a majority of the directors or
members of the committee of directors, but if any resolution is adopted otherwise than by the unanimous written
consent of all directors or all members of a committee of directors, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be
sent to all directors or all members of a committee of directors not consenting to such resolution. The consent
may be in the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the consent is in
one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the date
upon which sufficient number of directors to constitute a resolution of directors or a resolution of a committee of
directors has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

The directors may, by resolution-of directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of one or more
directors, and delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the seal, to the committee.

proposed distribution, satisfy the solvency test; or

(k) to authorize the Company to continue as a Company incorporated under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the British Virgin Islands.

Sub-Regulation 14.2(c) and (d) do not prevent a committee of directors, where authorised by the resolution of
directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent resolution of directors, from appointing a sub-committee
and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of 2 or more directors shall be governed
mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of directors so far as the same are not
superseded by any provisions in the resolution of directors establishing the committee.

Where the directors delegate their powers to a committee of directors they remain responsible for the exercise of
that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times before the exercise of the

for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to
believe that their conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best
interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles, unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle

unlawful.
