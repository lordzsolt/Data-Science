AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
OF
ALIEN METALS LIMITED

A COMPANY LIMITED BY SHARES

REGISTERED SHARES

The Company may (unless the Share issued is held in uncertificated form) issue to a Shareholder a
certificate signed by a Director of the Company and countersigned by the duly appointed transfer agent
of the Company with respect to Canadian issued certificates or under the Seal specifying the number of
Shares held by him and the signature of the Director and the transfer agent and the Seal may be
facsimiles.

Any Shareholder receiving a certificate shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Directors and
officers harmless from any loss or liability which it or they may incur by reason of any wrongful or
fraudulent use or representation made by any person by virtue of the possession thereof. If a certificate
for Shares is worn out or lost it may be renewed on production of the worn out certificate or on
satisfactory proof of its loss together with such indemnity as may be required by a Resolution of
Directors.

If several Eligible Persons are registered as joint holders of any Shares, any one of such Eligible
Persons may give an effectual receipt for any Distribution.

DEPOSITORY INTERESTS AND UNCERTIFICATED SHARES

The Directors shall, subject always to the Companies Acts, any other applicable laws and regulations
and the facilities and requirements of any Relevant System concerned and these Regulations, have
power to implement and/or approve any arrangements they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit in
relation to (without limitation) the evidencing of title to and transfer of interests in shares in the capital
of the Company in the form of depository interests or similar interests, instruments or securities, and to
the extent such arrangements are so implemented, no provision of these Regulations shall apply or have
effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with the holding or transfer therefore or the
shares in the capital of the Company represented thereby. The Directors may from time to time take
such actions and do such things as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit in relation to the
operation of any such arrangements.

Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may permit shares (or interests in shares) to be held in
uncertificated form and to be transferred by means of a Relevant System of holding and transferring
shares (or interests in shares) in uncertificated form and may determine that any class of shares shall
cease to be a participating security. Where the Board permits shares (or interests in such shares) to be
held in uncertificated form, Regulations 2.5 and 2.6 shall commence to have effect immediately prior to
the time at which the operator of the Relevant System concerned permits the class of shares (or interests
in such shares) to be a participating security.
-2-

 

2.3 Conversion of shares held in certificated form into shares (or interest in such shares) held in
uncertificated form, and vice versa, may be made in such manner as the Board may in its absolute
discretion think fit (subject to the facilities and requirements of the Relevant System).

2.4 Shares in the capital of the Company that fall within a certain class shall not form a separate class of
shares from other shares in that class because any share in that class is held in uncertificated form or is
permitted in accordance with the regulations of the Relevant System to become a participating security.

2.5 In relation to any class of shares (or interest in such shares) which is, for the time being, a participating
security, and for so long as such class remains a participating security, no provision of these
Regulations shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with:

(a) the holding of shares (or interest in such shares) of that class in uncertificated form;

(b) the transfer of title to shares (or interest in such shares) of that class by means of a Relevant
System; or

(c) the requirements of the Relevant System

and, without prejudice to the generality of this Regulation, no provision of these Regulations shall
apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with the maintenance, keeping or
entering up by the operator of the Relevant System, so long as that is permitted or required by the
regulations governing the Relevant System, of an operator register of securities in respect of shares of
that class in uncertificated form.

2.6 Without prejudice to the generality of Regulation 2.4 and notwithstanding anything contained in these
Regulations, where any class of shares (or interest in such shares) is, for the time being, a participating
security (such class being referred to hereinafter as the ''Relevant Class"’):

(a) the register relating to the Relevant Class shall be maintained at all times in such place as may
be determined by a Resolution of Directors; and

(b) unless the Directors otherwise determine, shares of the Relevant Class held by the same holder
or joint holder in certificated form and uncertificated form shall be treated as separate holdings.

3. COMPANY’S RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF UNCERTIFICATED SHARES

Where any class of shares (or interest in such shares) is a participating security and the Company is entitled
under the Companies Acts or the Articles to sell, transfer, dispose of, forfeit, re-allot, accept the surrender of or
otherwise enforce a lien over a share (or interest in such share) held in uncertificated form, the Company shall
be entitled, subject to the Companies Acts and the Articles and the facilities and requirements of the Relevant
System:

(d)

(e)

4.4.

4.5.

to require the holder of that uncertificated share (or interest in such share) by notice to change that
share (or interest in such shares) into certificated form within the period specified in the notice and to
hold that share in certificated form so long as required by the Company;

to require the holder of that uncertificated share (or interest in such share) by notice to give any
instructions necessary to transfer title to that share by means of the Relevant System within the period
specified in the notice;

to require the holder of that uncertificated share (or interest in such share) by notice to appoint any
person to take any steps, including without limitation the giving of any instructions by means of the
Relevant System, necessary to transfer that share within the period specified in the notice;

to take any action that the Board considers appropriate to achieve the sale, transfer, disposal of,
forfeiture, re-allotment or surrender of that share (or interest in such share) or otherwise to enforce a
lien in respect of it; and

to assume that the entries on any record of securities maintained by it in accordance with the
regulations governing the Relevant System and regularly reconciled with the relevant operator register
of securities are a complete and accurate reproduction of the particulars entered in the operator register
of securities and shall accordingly not be liable in respect of any act or thing done or omitted to be done
by or on behalf of the Company in reliance upon such assumption; in particular, any provision of these
Regulations which requires or envisages that action will be taken in reliance on information contained
in the register shall be construed to permit that action to be taken in reliance on information contained
in any relevant record of securities (as so maintained and reconciled).

SHARES

Shares and other Securities may be issued at such times, to such Eligible Persons, for such
consideration and on such terms as the Directors may by Resolution of Directors determine.

Section 46 of the Act (Pre-emptive rights) does not apply to the Company.

A Share may be issued for consideration in any form, including money, a promissory note, real
property, personal property (including goodwill and know-how) or a contract for future services.

No Shares may be issued for a consideration other than money, unless a Resolution of Directors has
been passed stating:

(a) the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares;

(b) their determination of the reasonable present cash value of the non-money consideration for the
issue; and

(c) that, in their opinion, the present cash value of the non-money consideration for the issue is not

less than the amount to be credited for the issue of the Shares.
The Company shall keep a register (the “register of members’’) containing:
(a) the names and addresses of the Eligible Persons who hold Shares;
(b) the number of each class and series of Shares held by each Shareholder;

(c) the date on which the name of each Shareholder was entered in the register of members; and

5.6.

5.7.

(d) the date on which any Eligible Person ceased to be a Shareholder.

The register of members may be in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in magnetic,
electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence of its
contents. Until the Directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or other data storage form
shall be the original register of members.

A Share is deemed to be issued when the name of the Shareholder is entered in the register of members.
REDEMPTION OF SHARES AND TREASURY SHARES

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own Shares save that the
Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent of
Shareholders whose Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the Company is
permitted by the Act or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.

The Company may only offer to acquire Shares if at the relevant time the Directors determine by
Resolution of Directors that immediately after the acquisition the value of the Company’s assets will
exceed its liabilities and the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due.

Sections 60 (Process for acquisition of own shares), 61 (Offer to one or more shareholders) and 62
(Shares redeemed otherwise than at the option of company) of the Act shall not apply to the Company.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to this Regulation may be
cancelled or held as Treasury Shares except to the extent that such Shares are in excess of 50 percent of
the issued Shares in which case they shall be cancelled but they shall be available for reissue.

All rights and obligations attaching to a Treasury Share are suspended and shall not be exercised by the
Company while it holds the Share as a Treasury Share.

Treasury Shares may be disposed of by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise
inconsistent with the Memorandum and Articles) as the Company may by Resolution of Directors
determine.

Where Shares are held by another body corporate of which the Company holds, directly or indirectly,
shares having more than 50 per cent of the votes in the election of Directors of the other body
corporate, all rights and obligations attaching to the Shares held by the other body corporate are
suspended and shall not be exercised by the other body corporate.

(a) “Excepted Transfer” means, in relation to Shares held by a Shareholder:
(1) a transfer pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer for the Company; or
(11) a transfer pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

(iii) a transfer where the directors are satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a bona
fide sale of the whole of the beneficial ownership of the Shares to a party unconnected
with the Shareholder or with any person appearing to be interested in such Shares
including any such sale made through the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange
ple or another stock exchange outside the United Kingdom on which Shares are

person who is a Significant Shareholder.

(c) “Relevant Change” means a change to the Holding of a Significant Shareholder above 3 per
cent. (excluding Treasury Shares) which increases or decreases such Holding through any
single percentage whether as a result of an acquisition or disposal of Shares or as a result of
events changing the breakdown of voting rights.

(d) “Relevant System” means a relevant system in which the Shares are a participating security at
the relevant time;

(e) “Significant Shareholder” means a Shareholder of 3 per cent. or more of Shares in the
Company (excluding Treasury Shares).

A Shareholder must notify the Company without delay of any Relevant Change, disclosing:

Shares held by such Shareholder and the nature of such interest;

(b) the identity of the person, if any, entitled to exercise voting rights on behalf of such
Shareholder;

(c) the date on which the Relevant Change to the Holding was effected;

(d) the price and amount of the Shares concerned;
(e) the nature of the transaction;
(f) the nature and extent of the Significant Shareholder’s interest in the transaction;

(g) the percentage Holding of the Significant Shareholder of Shares in the Company and the

(b) the aggregate of all voting rights held as direct or indirect Shareholder.

and a Shareholder is required to notify the Company if the overall percentage level of his voting rights
remains the same but there is a notifiable change in the percentage level of one of the categories of
voting rights held.

Any notification required to be made by a Shareholder under Sub-Regulation 5.9 must be made in
writing to the Company without delay. To the extent a Shareholder is not lawfully able to make a
notification under Sub-Regulation 5.9, such Shareholder shall use reasonable endeavours to procure
that the relevant person notifies his interests to the Company without delay.

The directors shall have power by notice in writing to require any Shareholder to disclose to the
Company the identity of any person other than the Shareholder who has any interest in the Shares held
by the Shareholder and the nature of such interest. Any such notice shall be in such form as the
directors approve and shall require any information in response to such notice to be given in writing
within such reasonable time as the directors shall determine.
If:

(a) it shall come to the notice of the directors that any Shareholder has not, within the requisite
period made or, as the case may be, procured the making of any notification required by Sub-
Regulation 5.9; or

(b) any Shareholder or another person whom the Company knows or has reasonable cause to

believe to be interested in Shares held by that Shareholder has been duly served with a notice
given by the directors in accordance with Sub-Regulation 5.12 and the Shareholder or other
person is in default for 14 days from the date of the service of the notice in supplying to the
Company the information thereby required,

then the directors may in their absolute discretion at any time thereafter serve a notice (a “Direction
Notice’) upon such Shareholder.

A Direction Notice may direct that, in respect of:
(a) the Shares in relation to which the default occurred;

(b) any other Shares held by the Shareholder (including any shares issued to such Shareholder after
the date of the issue of the notice referred to in Sub-Regulation 5.12 or the date on which
notification was required under Sub-Regulation 5.9;

(together the “Default Shares’’)

the Shareholder shall have no right to be present or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders or on a
Resolution of Shareholders or separate meeting of the holders of any class of Shares of the Company
(or on a resolution of such class of Shareholders) either personally or by proxy or to exercise any other
right in connection with meetings of the Company or on a poll the holders of any class of Shares of the
Company in relation to any meeting or poll (or with respect to any Resolution of Shareholders).

Where the Default Shares represent at least 0.25 per cent. in nominal value of the issued Shares of their
class (calculated exclusive of any Shares held as Treasury Shares), then the Direction Notice may
additionally direct that:

(a) in respect of the Default Shares any dividend or part thereof which would otherwise be payable
on such Shares shall be withheld by the Company without any liability to pay interest thereon
when such money is finally paid to the Shareholder and the Shareholder is not entitled to
receive shares instead of a dividend; and/or

(b) no transfer of any of the Default Shares shall be recognised or registered by directors unless; (i)
the transfer is an Excepted Transfer; or (ii) the Shareholder is not himself in default as regards
supplying the requisite information required under this Regulation and, when presented for
registration the transfer is accompanied by a certificate by the Shareholder in a form
satisfactory to the directors to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the Shareholder is
satisfied no person in default in supplying the information required is interested in any of the
shares the subject of the transfer; or (iii) registration of the transfer is required by any Relevant
System.

(and, for the purpose of ensuring this Sub-Regulation 5.15 can apply to all Shares held by the holder,
the Company may, in accordance with the regulations of any Relevant System, issue written
notification to the operator of the Relevant System requiring the conversion into certificated form of
any Shares held by the holder in uncertificated form).

The sanctions under Sub-Regulations 5.14 and 5.15 shall cease to apply seven days after the earlier of
receipt by the Company of:

(a) notice of registration of an Excepted Transfer, by the notification required by Sub-Regulations
5.9 to 5.11 or in relation to the Default Shares the subject of the Excepted Transfer; and

(b) all information required by the notice under Sub-Regulation 5.12 or all information required to
be included in the notification required by Sub-Regulations 5.9 to 5.11, as the case may be in a
form satisfactory to a director or officer of the Company, in relation to any Default Shares.

Where on the basis of information obtained from a Shareholder in respect of a Share held by him, the

Company issues a notice under Sub-Regulation 5.12 to another person, it shall at the same time send a

copy of the relevant notice to the Shareholder, but the accidental omission to do so, or the non-receipt

Regulations 5.13 to 5.14.

Sub-Regulations 5.8 - 5.17 above are in addition to and without prejudice to the Act.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF SHARES

Shareholders may mortgage or charge their Shares.

There shall be entered in the register of members at the written request of the Shareholder:
(a) a statement that the Shares held by him are mortgaged or charged;

(b) the name of the mortgagee or chargee; and

(c) the date on which the particulars specified in subparagraphs (a) and (b) are entered in the
register of members.

Where particulars of a mortgage or charge are entered in the register of members, such particulars may
be cancelled:

(a) with the written consent of the named mortgagee or chargee or anyone authorised to act on his
behalf; or

(b) upon evidence satisfactory to the Directors of the discharge of the liability secured by the
mortgage or charge and the issue of such indemnities as the Directors shall consider necessary
or desirable.

Whilst particulars of a mortgage or charge over Shares are entered in the register of members pursuant
to this Regulation:

(a) no transfer of any Share the subject of those particulars shall be effected;

FORFEITURE

Shares that are not fully paid on issue are subject to the forfeiture provisions set forth in this Regulation
and for this purpose Shares issued for a promissory note or a contract for future services are deemed to
be not fully paid.

A written notice of call specifying the date for payment to be made shall be served on the Shareholder
who defaults in making payment in respect of the Shares.

The written notice of call referred to in Sub-Regulation 7.2 shall name a further date not earlier than the
expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice on or before which the payment required by
the notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before the
time named in the notice the Shares, or any of them, in respect of which payment is not made will be
liable to be forfeited.

Where a written notice of call has been issued pursuant to Sub-Regulation 7.3 and the requirements of
the notice have not been complied with, the Directors may, at any time before tender of payment, forfeit
and cancel the Shares to which the notice relates.

The Company is under no obligation to refund any moneys to the Shareholder whose Shares have been
cancelled pursuant to Sub-Regulation 7 and that Shareholder shall be discharged from any further
obligation to the Company.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Shares may be transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and containing
the name and address of the transferee, which shall be sent to the Company at the office of its registered

agent for registration or at any other place as determined by the Board.

The transfer of a Share is effective when the name of the transferee is entered on the register of
members.

If the Directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares has been
signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by Resolution of Directors:

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the
absence of the instrument of transfer.

Subject to the Memorandum, the personal representative of a deceased Shareholder may transfer a
Share even though the personal representative is not a Shareholder at the time of the transfer.

DIVISION AND COMBINATION OF SHARES

The Company may by a Resolution of Directors with the prior consent of the Shareholders by way of a
Special Resolution:

(a) divide its shares, including issued shares, into a larger number of shares; or
(b) combine its shares, including issued shares, into a smaller number of shares.

A division or combination of shares, including issued shares, of a class or series shall be for a larger or
smaller number, as the case may be, of shares in the same class or series.

number of shares that the Company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum to be exceeded.

Where shares with par value are divided or combined under this Regulation 9, the aggregate par value
of the new shares must be equal to the aggregate par value of the original shares.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Subject to Regulation 10.3, the Directors of the Company may convene meetings of the Shareholders at
such times and in such manner and places as the Directors consider necessary or desirable. Meetings of
Shareholders may be held or participated at by telephone or other electronic means if all Shareholders
and/or their proxies and authorised representatives are able to hear each other throughout. Where one or
more Shareholders participate in the meeting via electronic means, the meeting shall nonetheless be
deemed to be held in the place specified in the notice of meeting sent by the Directors.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 30 per cent or more of the voting rights in
respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the Directors shall convene a meeting of
Shareholders.

An Annual General Meeting shall be held in each year (in addition to any other General Meetings
which may be held in that year) and such meeting shall be specified as the Annual General Meeting in
the notice calling it. Not more than 15 months shall elapse between the date of one Annual General
Meeting and the date of the next. Subject to this Regulation and the Companies Acts, the Annual
General Meeting shall be held in the United Kingdom at such time and place in the United Kingdom as
the Board shall decide.

All meetings of the Shareholders other than Annual General Meetings are called General Meetings (but
unless the context requires otherwise, a General Meeting shall also mean an Annual General Meeting).
All General Meetings shall be held at such time and place in the United Kingdom as the Board shall
decide.

At least 21 clear days’ notice of every Annual General Meeting and of every General Meeting at which
it is proposed to pass a Special Resolution and at least 14 clear days’ notice of every other General
Meeting shall be given to such Shareholders as are, under the Articles or the terms of issue of shares,
entitled to receive such notices from the Company and to the Directors. Every notice of meeting shall
specify whether the meeting is an Annual General Meeting or an General Meeting, the place, date and
time of the meeting, if a meeting is convened to pass a Special Resolution or a Resolution of
Shareholders, the intention to propose the resolution as a Special Resolution or a Resolution of
Shareholders (as the case may be) and shall state, with reasonable prominence, that a Shareholder
entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a
poll, vote instead of him and that a proxy need not also be a Shareholder.

Notice shall be given to those Shareholders whose names on the date the notice is given appear as
Shareholders in the register of members of the Company and are entitled to vote at the meeting.

The Directors shall fix as the record date for determining those Shareholders that are entitled to vote at
the meeting, such date as they deem appropriate.

In the case of any General Meeting at which business other than routine business (as defined in
Regulation 10.12) is to be transacted, the notice shall specify the general nature of such business; and if
any resolution is to be proposed as a Special Resolution, the notice shall contain a statement to that
effect.
-10-

 

10.9. Notice of a General Meeting or the Annual General Meeting shall be sent to a person in writing or by
using electronic communications to such electronic address as may for the time being be notified by
that person to the Company for that purpose or in accordance with the following provisions of this
Regulation 10.9.

(a) Notice of a General Meeting or the Annual General Meeting shall also be treated as sent to a
person using electronic communications where:

(1) the Company and that person have agreed that notices of General Meetings or the
Annual General Meeting required to be given to that person may instead be accessed by
him on a website;

(11) the meeting is a meeting to which that agreement applies;

(iii) that person is notified, in a manner for the time being agreed between him and the
Company for the purpose, of:

(A) the publication of the notice on a website;
(B) the electronic address of that website; and

(C) the place on that website where the notice may be accessed, and how it may be
accessed; and

(iv) the notice continues to be published on that website throughout the period beginning
with the giving of that notification and ending with the conclusion of the meeting,

and a notice treated in accordance with this Regulation as sent to any person is to be treated as

so sent at the time of the notification mentioned in Regulation 10.9(a)(iii).
(b) A notification given for the purposes of Regulation 10.9(a)(iii) must:

(1) state that it concerns a notice of a General Meeting or Annual General Meeting sent in
accordance with the Articles and the Act;

(ii) specify the place, date and time of the meeting; and
(111) state whether the meeting is to be an Annual General Meeting or a General Meeting.
(c) Nothing in Regulation 10.9 shall invalidate the proceedings of a General Meeting where:

(i) any notice that is required to be published as mentioned in Regulation 10.9(a)(iv) is
published for a part, but not all, of the period mentioned in that Regulation; and

(11) the failure to publish that notice throughout that period is wholly attributable to
circumstances which it would not be reasonable to have expected the Company to
prevent or avoid.

10.10. A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if such

meeting is called by shorter notice than that specified above if it is so agreed or notice is waived:

(a) in the case of an Annual General Meeting, by all the Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at
the meeting;

10.11.

10.12.

10.13.

10.14.

(b) in the case of any General Meeting, by a majority in number of the Shareholders having a right
to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than 90 per cent of
the votes of the Shares having a right to attend and vote at the meeting.

The inadvertent failure or the accidental omission of the Directors to send notice of any General
Meeting or Annual General Meeting to a Shareholder or the fact that a Shareholder has not received
notice, does not invalidate the meeting or, in cases where an invitation to appoint a proxy is
inadvertently not sent out with the notice, or in the case of the non-receipt of either an invitation to
appoint a proxy or a notice by, any person entitled to receive notice does not invalidate any resolution
passed or proceedings held at that meeting.

Routine business shall mean and include only business transacted at an Annual General Meeting of the
following classes, that is to say:

(a) approving the declaring dividends, where such dividends have been declared by the Directors.;

(b) receiving and/or adopting the accounts, the reports of the Directors and auditors and other
documents required to be attached or annexed to the accounts;

(c) appointing or re-appointing Directors to fill vacancies arising at the meeting on retirement
whether by rotation or otherwise;

(d) re-appointing the retiring auditors (unless they were last appointed otherwise than by the
Company in General Meeting);

(e) fixing the remuneration of the auditors or determining the manner in which such remuneration
is to be fixed.

All other business transacted at an Annual General Meeting and all business transacted at a General
Meeting other than an Annual General Meeting shall be deemed special.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak and vote on
behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting before the
time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote. The
notice of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or time at which the proxy shall be
presented.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following form or such other form as the
chairman of the meeting shall accept as properly evidencing the wishes of the Shareholder appointing
the proxy.

adjournment thereof.

(Any restrictions on voting to be inserted here.)

Signed this

Shareholder

 

The following applies where Shares are jointly owned:

(a) if two or more persons hold Shares jointly each of them may be present in person or by proxy at
a meeting of Shareholders and may speak as a Shareholder;

(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf of all
joint owners; and

(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one.

A Shareholder or his proxy shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of Shareholders if he participates
by telephone, other electronic means or audio-visual link and all Shareholders participating in the
meeting are able to hear each other and the chairman of the meeting shall make appropriate
arrangements for such persons to vote on any show of hands or poll as the case may require.

No business shall be transacted at any meeting of the Shareholders unless a quorum is present when the
meeting proceeds to business. Two persons entitled to vote, each being a Shareholder or a proxy for a
Shareholder, shall be a quorum at any meeting including, without limitation, any adjourned meetings.
The absence of a quorum does not prevent the appointment of a chairman in accordance with the
Articles, which is not treated as part of the business of the meeting.

If within 15 minutes (or such longer period as the chairman in his absolute discretion may decide) from
the time fixed for the start of a meeting a quorum is not present, or if during a meeting a quorum ceases
to be present, the meeting, if convened by or on the requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved. In
any other case it shall stand adjourned to such time and place as the chairman of the meeting may
decide not being later than 28 days after the time for which the original meeting was convened.

At an adjourned meeting if a quorum is not present within 15 minutes (or such longer period as the
chairman in his absolute discretion may decide) from the time fixed for the start of the meeting or if
during the adjourned meeting a quorum ceases to be present the adjourned meeting shall be dissolved.

The Company shall give not less than seven clear days’ notice of any meeting adjourned for the lack of
a quorum and the notice shall state the quorum requirement.

The chairman of the meeting may, with the consent of the meeting at which a quorum is present (and
shall, if so directed by the meeting) adjourn any meeting from time to time and from place to place or
for an indefinite period. Without prejudice to any other power which he may have under the Articles or
at common law, the chairman may, without the consent of the meeting, interrupt or adjourn a meeting

from time to time and from place to place or for an indefinite period if he decides that it has become
necessary to do so in order to:

(a) secure the proper and orderly conduct of the meeting; or

(b) give all persons entitled to do so a reasonable opportunity of speaking and voting at the
meeting; or

(c) ensure that the business of the meeting is properly dealt with.

Whenever a meeting is adjourned for 14 days or more or for an indefinite period, at least seven clear
days’ notice, specifying the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case
of an original meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted.

Except in the circumstances set out in Regulations 10.21 and 10.23 no Shareholder shall be entitled to
any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting. No business
shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business which might have been transacted
at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

If it appears to the chairman that the meeting place specified in the notice convening the meeting is
inadequate to accommodate all Shareholders entitled and wishing to attend, the meeting will be duly
constituted and its proceedings will be valid if the chairman is satisfied that adequate facilities are
available to ensure that a Shareholder who is unable to be accommodated is able:

(a) to participate in the business for which the meeting has been convened;

(b) to hear and see all persons present who speak (whether by the use of microphones, loud-
speakers, audio-visual communications equipment or otherwise), whether in the meeting place
or elsewhere; and

(c) to be heard and seen by all other persons present in the same way.

At every meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall preside as chairman of the meeting.
If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present at the meeting, the
Shareholders present shall choose one of their number to be the chairman. If the Shareholders are
unable to choose a chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest number of voting
Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as chairman failing which the oldest
individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

The chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from
place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left
unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the Shareholders the chairman is responsible for deciding in such manner as he
considers appropriate whether any resolution proposed has been carried or not and the result of his
decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes of the meeting. If the chairman
has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken
of all votes cast upon such resolution. If the chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present
in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may
immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a
poll to be taken. If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and
recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of representatives of
Eligible Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak for or represent a
Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by the documents by which,
the Eligible Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the Directors may in good
faith seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction
shall otherwise rule, the Directors may rely and act upon such advice without incurring any liability to
any Shareholder or the Company.

Any Eligible Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its Directors
or other governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any
meeting of Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be
entitled to exercise the same rights on behalf of the Eligible Person which he represents as that Eligible
Person could exercise if it were an individual.

Directors of the Company may attend and speak at any meeting of Shareholders and at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

An action that may be taken by the Shareholders at a meeting may also be taken by a Resolution of
Shareholders consented to in writing or by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile or other electronic
communication, without the need for any notice, but if any Resolution of Shareholders is adopted
otherwise than by the unanimous written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall
forthwith be sent to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the form
of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders. If the consent is in one or
more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect on the
earliest date upon which Eligible Persons holding a sufficient number of votes of Shares to constitute a
Resolution of Shareholders have consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

DIRECTORS

Subject to the Companies Acts and these Articles, the Company may, by Resolution of Shareholders,
appoint a person who is willing to act to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the
Board, but the total number of Directors may not exceed a maximum number fixed in accordance with
the Articles.

No person shall be appointed as a Director of the Company unless he has consented in writing to act as
a Director.

The minimum number of Directors shall be (1) one and the maximum number shall be twelve (12).

Each Director holds office for the term, if any, fixed by the Resolution of Shareholders or Resolution of
Directors appointing him, or until his earlier death, resignation, removal or retirement by rotation. If no
term is fixed on the appointment of a Director, the Director serves indefinitely until his earlier death,
resignation, removal or retirement by rotation.

A Director may be removed from office,

(a) with or without cause, by a Resolution of Shareholders passed at a meeting of Shareholders
called for the purposes of removing the Director or for purposes including the removal of the
Director or by a written resolution passed by a least seventy five per cent of the Shareholders of
the Company entitled to vote; or

(b) with cause, by a Resolution of Directors passed at a meeting of Directors called for the purpose
of removing the Director or for purposes including the removal of the Director.

A Director may resign his office by giving written notice of his resignation to the Company and the
resignation has effect from the date the notice is received by the Company or from such later date as
may be specified in the notice. A Director shall resign forthwith as a Director if he is, or becomes,
disqualified from acting as a Director under the Act.

The Board may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an
addition to the Board, but the total number of Directors may not exceed a maximum number fixed in
accordance with the Articles. A Director so appointed shall hold office only until the dissolution of the
Annual General Meeting following next after his appointment, unless he is reappointed during the
meeting. A Director so retiring shall not be taken into account in determining the number of Directors
who are to retire by rotation at such meeting.

A vacancy in relation to Directors occurs if a Director dies or otherwise ceases to hold office prior to
the expiration of his term of office.

Each Director shall retire from office at the third Annual General Meeting after that at which he was
last elected, save that at the first Annual General Meeting following the adoption of these Regulations
all directors shall retire and, if they so wish, offer themselves up for re-election to the Board.

Subject to the Companies Act and the Articles, the Directors to retire by rotation at the Annual General
Meeting in every year shall be in addition to any Director who wishes to retire and not to offer himself
for reappointment and any Director to retire under Regulation 11.7.

A Director who retires at an Annual General Meeting, whether by rotation or otherwise, may, if willing
to act, be reappointed. If he is not reappointed or deemed reappointed, he may retain office until the
meeting appoints someone in his place or, if it does not do so, until the end of the meeting.

The Company, at the meeting at which a Director retires by rotation, may fill the vacated office and, if
it does not do so, the retiring Director is, if willing, deemed reappointed, unless at such meeting it is
expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the reappointment of such
Director is put to the meeting and lost.

No person other than a Director retiring at the meeting is eligible for appointment or reappointment as a
Director at any General Meeting or Annual General Meeting unless he is recommended by the Board
for election, or, not less than seven nor more than 42 days before the day fixed for the meeting, notice
in writing to the secretary or any Director of the Company at the office of its registered agent for
registration or at any other place as determined by the Board executed by a Shareholder qualified to be
present and vote at the meeting has been sent of his intention to propose such person for appointment or
reappointment, accompanied by notice in writing, executed by the person to be proposed, of his
willingness to be appointed or reappointed. The notice from the Shareholder shall give the particulars
in respect of that person which would (if he were appointed or reappointed) be required to be included
in the Company's register of Directors.

Every resolution of a General Meeting for the appointment or reappointment of a Director shall relate
to one named person and a single resolution for the appointment or reappointment of two or more
persons as Directors is void.

The Company shall keep a register of Directors containing:

(a) the names and addresses of the persons who are Directors of the Company;

(b) the date on which each person whose name is entered in the register was appointed as a
Director of the Company;

(c) the date on which each person named as a Director ceased to be a Director of the Company;

(d) such other information as may be prescribed by the Act.

The register of Directors may be kept in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in
magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible evidence
of its contents. Until a Resolution of Directors determining otherwise is passed, the magnetic,
electronic or other data storage shall be the original register of Directors.

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, fix the emoluments of Directors with respect to
services to be rendered in any capacity to the Company.

A Director is not required to hold a Share as a qualification to office.
POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the direction or supervision of,
the Directors of the Company. The Directors of the Company have all the powers necessary for
managing, and for directing and supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The Directors
may pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation or re-registration
of the Company and may exercise all such powers of the Company as are not by the Act or by the
Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.

Each Director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or agree to the Company
acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the Articles or the Act. Each Director, in
exercising his powers or performing his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith in what the Director
believes to be the best interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company, a Director of the Company may,
when exercising powers or performing duties as a Director, act in a manner which he believes is in the
best interests of the holding company even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

Any Director which is a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly authorised representative
for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the Directors, with respect to the signing of consents or
otherwise.

The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The Directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company to incur
indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities or obligations whether of
the Company or of any third party.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all
receipts for moneys paid to the Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise
executed, as the case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution of
Directors.

For the purposes of Section 175 (Disposition of assets) of the Act, the Directors may by Resolution of
Directors determine that any sale, transfer, lease, exchange or other disposition is in the usual or regular
course of the business carried on by the Company and such determination is, in the absence of fraud,
conclusive.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

Any one Director of the Company may call a meeting of the Directors by sending a written notice to
each other Director.

The Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may meet at such times and in such manner
and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors may determine to be necessary
or desirable. Meetings of Directors may be held or participated at by telephone or other electronic
means if all Directors present and/or their duly appointed alternates are able to hear each other
throughout. Where one or more Directors participate in the meeting via electronic means, the meeting
shall nonetheless be deemed to be held in the place specified in the notice of meeting sent by the
Directors.

A Director is deemed to be present at a meeting of Directors if he participates by telephone or other
electronic means and all Directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A Director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of Directors, but a meeting of
Directors held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all Directors shall be valid if all the
Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the meeting, and for this
purpose the presence of a Director at a meeting shall constitute waiver by that Director. The
inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director has not received
the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a Director and the
alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the Director who appointed him and to
vote or consent in place of the Director until the appointment lapses or is terminated. If a Director
retires at any meeting (whether by rotation or otherwise) but is reappointed by the meeting at which
such retirement took effect, any appointment made by him under this Regulation which was in force
immediately prior to his retirement shall continue to operate after his reappointment as if he had not so
retired. The appointment of an alternate Director ceases on the happening of an event which, if he were
a Director otherwise appointed, would cause him to vacate office.

A meeting of Directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there
are present in person or by alternate 2 Directors.

If the Company has only one Director the provisions herein contained for meetings of Directors do not
apply and such sole Director has full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are
not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu
of minutes of a meeting the sole Director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum constitutes sufficient
evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of Directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall preside as chairman of
the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board is not present, the
Directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

An action that may be taken by the Directors or a committee of Directors at a meeting may also be
taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of Directors consented to in writing or
by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile or other electronic communication by all Directors or by all
members of the committee, as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in
the form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more Directors. If the consent is in
one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect
on the date upon which the last Director has consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

COMMITTEES
The Directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting of
one or more Directors, and delegate one or more of their powers, including the power to affix the Seal,

to the committee.

The Directors have no power to delegate to a committee of Directors any of the following powers:

(a) to designate committees of Directors;
(b) to delegate powers to a committee of Directors;
(c) to appoint Directors;

(d) to appoint an agent;
(e) to approve a plan of merger, consolidation or arrangement; or
(f) to make a declaration of solvency or to approve a liquidation plan.

Sub-Regulations 14.2(a) and 14.2(b) do not prevent a committee of Directors, where authorised by the
Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a subsequent Resolution of Directors, from
appointing a sub-committee and delegating powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of Directors consisting of 2 or more Directors shall
be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the proceedings of Directors
so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the Resolution of Directors establishing the
committee.

Where the Directors delegate their powers to a committee of Directors they remain responsible for the
exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on reasonable grounds at all times before
the exercise of the power that the committee would exercise the power in conformity with the duties
imposed on Directors of the Company under the Act.

OFFICERS AND AGENTS

The Company may by Resolution of Directors appoint officers of the Company at such times as may be
considered necessary or expedient. Such officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board of Directors,
a president and one or more vice-presidents, secretaries and treasurers and such other officers as may
from time to time be considered necessary or expedient. Any number of offices may be held by the
same person.

The officers shall perform such duties as are prescribed at the time of their appointment subject to any
modification in such duties as may be prescribed thereafter by Resolution of Directors. In the absence
of any specific prescription of duties it shall be the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board to
preside at meetings of Directors and Shareholders, the president to manage the day to day affairs of the
Company, the vice-presidents to act in order of seniority in the absence of the president but otherwise
to perform such duties as may be delegated to them by the president, the secretaries to maintain the
register of members, minute books and records (other than financial records) of the Company and to
ensure compliance with all procedural requirements imposed on the Company by applicable law, and
the treasurer to be responsible for the financial affairs of the Company.

The emoluments of all officers shall be fixed by Resolution of Directors.

The officers of the Company shall hold office until their successors are duly appointed, but any officer
elected or appointed by the Directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by Resolution
of Directors. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by Resolution of
Directors.

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, appoint any person, including a person who is a
Director, to be an agent of the Company. An agent of the Company shall have such powers and
authority of the Directors, including the power and authority to affix the Seal, as are set forth in the
Articles or in the Resolution of Directors appointing the agent, except that no agent has any power or
authority with respect to the matters specified in Sub-Regulation 14.2. The Resolution of Directors
appointing an agent may authorise the agent to appoint one or more substitutes or delegates to exercise
some or all of the powers conferred on the agent by the Company. The Directors may remove an agent
appointed by the Company and may revoke or vary a power conferred on him.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

A Director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a
transaction entered into or to be entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to all other Directors
of the Company.

Subject to the Companies Acts and to Regulation 16.1, a Director, notwithstanding his office:

(a) may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except that of auditor) in
conjunction with his office of Director and on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as
the Board may arrange. Any Director may act by himself or through his firm in a professional
capacity for the Company (otherwise than as auditor) and he or his firm shall be entitled to
remuneration for such professional services;

(b) may enter into or otherwise be interested in a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal
with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested either in connection with
his tenure of an office or place of profit and either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise;

(c) may be a member or Director or other officer of or employed by or a party to a contract,
transaction, arrangement or proposal with or be otherwise interested in a company promoted by
the Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested;

(d) unless otherwise agreed, is not liable to account to the Company for any remuneration, profit or
other benefit received by him by virtue of such office, employment, contract, arrangement,
transaction or proposal and no such contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal is avoided
on the grounds of any such interest or benefit.

Except as provided in this Regulation, a Director may not vote in respect of any contract, arrangement,
transaction or proposal to which the Company is or is to be a party and in which he is, to his
knowledge, materially interested, directly or indirectly, otherwise than by virtue of his interest in shares
or debentures or other securities of or otherwise in or through the Company. This prohibition does not
apply to any resolution concerning any of the following matters namely:

(a) the giving to him of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of money lent or obligations
incurred by him or by any other person at the request of or for the benefit of the Company or
any of its subsidiary undertakings;
-20 -

 

16.4.

16.5.

(b) the giving to a third party of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of a debt or obligation
of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which he himself has assumed
responsibility, in whole or in part, under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;

(c) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning an offer of shares or debentures or
other securities of or by the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for subscription or
purchase in which offer he is or may be entitled to participate as a holder of securities or in the
underwriting or sub-underwriting of which the Director is to participate;

(d) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal to which the Company is or is to be a party
concerning any other company in which he is interested directly or indirectly and whether as an
officer or shareholder or otherwise (“relevant company”’), if he is not, directly or indirectly,
the holder of or beneficially interested in one per cent or more of a class of equity share capital
of the relevant company (calculated exclusive of any shares of that class in that relevant
company held as treasury shares) or of the voting rights available to members of the relevant
company or able to cause one per cent or more of those voting rights to be cast at his direction
(and for the purposes of this Regulation, shares held by a Director as bare or custodian trustee
and in which he has no beneficial interest, shares comprised in a trust and in which the
Director’s interest is in reversion or is in remainder, if and so long as another person is entitled
to receive the income from the trust, and shares comprised in an authorised unit trust scheme in
which the Director is interested only as a unit holder are disregarded);

(e) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning the adoption, modification or
operation of a pension, superannuation or similar scheme or retirement, death or disability
benefits scheme or personal pension plan or employees’ share scheme under which he may
benefit and which has been approved by or is subject to and conditional on approval by a
relevant tax authority for taxation purposes or which does not accord to any Director as such
any privilege or benefit not accorded to the employees to whom the scheme or fund relates;

(f) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal for the benefit of employees of the Company or
any of its subsidiary undertakings under which the Director benefits in a similar manner to the
employees and which does not accord to any Director as such any privilege or benefit not
accorded to the employees to whom it relates; or

(g) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning the maintenance or purchase of any
insurance policy which the Company is permitted by law to purchase and/or maintain for the
benefit of Directors or for the benefit of persons including Directors.

A Director may not vote or be counted in the quorum on a resolution of the Board or committee of the
Board concerning his own appointment (including fixing or varying the terms of his appointment or its
termination) as the holder of an office or place of profit with the Company or any company in which the
Company is interested. Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment
(including fixing or varying the terms of appointment or its termination) of two or more Directors to
offices or places of profit with the Company or any company in which the Company is interested, such
proposals shall be divided and a separate resolution considered in relation to each Director. In such
cases each of the Directors concerned (if not otherwise debarred from voting under the Articles) is
entitled to vote (and be counted in the quorum) in respect of each resolution except that concerning his
own appointment.

If any question arises at any meeting of the Directors or any committee of Directors as to the materiality
of a Director’s interest or as to the entitlement of any Director to vote or be counted in a quorum and
such question is not resolved by his voluntarily agreeing to abstain from voting or being counted in a
quorum, the question shall be decided by a resolution of the remaining Directors or committee members
present at the meeting and in the case of an equality of votes the chairman (unless he is the Director the

materiality of whose interest or entitlement to vote is in issue) shall have a second or casting vote which
shall be conclusive and binding.

For the purpose of Regulations 16.2 to 16.5, the interest of a person who is connected (within the
meaning of Sections 252 and 254 of the UK Act, a copy of which is appended to these Regulations)
with a Director is treated as the interest of the Director and, in relation to an alternate Director, the
interest of the Director appointing him shall be treated as the interest of the alternate Director in
addition to any interest which the alternate Director otherwise has. Regulations 16.2 to 16.6 apply to an
alternate Director as if he were a Director otherwise appointed.

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company shall indemnify against all expenses,
including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably
incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who:

(a) is Or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
the person is or was a Director of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a Director of, or in any other capacity is or
was acting for, another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The indemnity in Sub-Regulation 17.1 only applies if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a
view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the person had no
reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the Directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view
to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe
that his conduct was unlawful is, in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of the Articles,
unless a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a
nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good
faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable cause to
believe that his conduct was unlawful.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a Director,
officer or liquidator of the Company, or who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a
Director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another company or a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and
incurred by the person in that capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power
to indemnify the person against the liability as provided in the Articles.

26. TAKE-OVER OFFERS FOR THE COMPANY

26.1

(a) Where any person is or becomes interested, whether as a result of transactions over a period of
time or not, in shares in the Capital of the Company in circumstances in which he would be
obliged to make or extend an offer or offers to Shareholders or holders of other securities or
rights referred to in Regulation 26.4 below of the Company under the Rules for the time being
of The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers of the United Kingdom (the "City Code", which
expression shall include any revision or modification thereof) issued by the Panel on Take-
25 -

 

26.2

26.3

26.4

26.5

overs and Mergers ("the Panel", which expression shall include any body which succeeds to
the functions of the said Panel) if the Company was a company incorporated in the United
Kingdom to which the City Code applied, the Directors may serve upon that person a notice
requiring him to make or extend an offer or offers in writing in accordance with the
requirements of the City Code in all respects as if the City Code did apply to the Company but
so that references in the City Code to the Panel shall be construed, for the purposes of
Regulation 26.1 as if they were references to the Board.

(b) The provisions of the Articles relating to the protection of purchasers of shares sold under a
lien or upon forfeiture shall apply mutatis mutandis to disposals under Regulation 26.

Any notice served under Regulation 26.1 may also require the person on whom it is served to execute
an undertaking under seal in favour of the Directors (as trustees for all the holders of shares in the
capital of the Company) and in a form satisfactory to the Directors to observe and perform the rules and
requirements of the City Code as if the same were applicable to the Company and in the manner
prescribed in Regulation 26.1.

Where any person is interested, whether as a result of series of transactions over a period of time or not,
in shares which (taken together with shares held or acquired by persons acting in concert with him)
represent 30 per cent or more of all the shares for the time being in issue and the Directors determine
that it is not expedient to serve a notice under sub-Regulation 26.1(a) or if any person upon whom such
a notice is served fails within thirty days to comply with the same, the Directors may serve upon that
person a notice requiring him to make an offer in writing (the "Offer"), within 30 days of the date of
such notice on the basis set out in the following paragraphs, to the holders of every class of share
capital of the Company (whether voting or non-voting) to purchase all such shares for cash on terms
that payment in full therefor will be made within 21 days of the Offer becoming or being declared
unconditional in all respects.26.4 Where the Directors serve a notice upon any person in
accordance with sub-Regulation 26.3, they may also include in that notice a requirement that such
person shall make an appropriate offer or proposal in writing to the holders of every class of securities
convertible into, or of rights to subscribe for, share capital of the Company (whether such share capital
is voting or non-voting). Such appropriate offer or proposal is referred to in Regulation 26 as a
"Convertible Offer". The Convertible Offer shall be made at the same time as the Offer. The terms of
the Convertible Offer shall be such terms as the Directors, in their absolute discretion, consider to be
fair and reasonable having regard to the terms of the Offer and the Directors shall notify such terms to
the person specified in sub-Regulation 26.3 (the "Offeror"). The Convertible Offer shall be conditional
only upon the Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects.

In addition to the Offeror, the Directors may require, in their absolution discretion, each of the principal
members of a group of persons acting in concert with him and who appear to be interested in any shares
in, or convertible securities of, the Company to make the Offer and/or the Convertible Offer. For the
purposes of this Regulation, persons shall be deemed to be acting in concert if, pursuant to an
agreement or understanding (whether formal or informal) they actively co-operate in acquiring or
seeking to acquire shares in, or convertible securities of, the Company.

Unless the Directors otherwise agree, an offer made under sub-Regulations 26.3, 26.4 or 26.5 must, in
respect of each class of share capital or convertible securities involved, be in cash or be accompanied
by a cash alternative offer at not less than the highest price paid by the Offeror or any person acting in
concert with it for shares or convertible securities of that class within the preceding 12 months. If such
price cannot be ascertained by the Directors or if such shares or convertible securities have been
acquired other than for cash pursuant to a bargain made on any recognised stock exchange or if the
Directors consider that such highest price is, for any reason, inappropriate, unfair or unreasonable
having regard to the size and timing of the relevant purchases, the relationship (if any) between the
seller and purchaser of such shares or convertible securities or the number of shares or convertible

securities purchased in the preceding 12 months, the Directors may, in any such case, fix the price at
which the Offer, the Convertible Offer or the cash alternative offer is to be made. The cash Offer, the
cash Convertible Offer or the cash alternative offer must, in each case, remain open for not less than 14
days after the date on which the Offer or the Convertible Offer, as the case may be, has become or is
declared to be unconditional as to acceptances.

Any person who makes or is about to make or who is or can be required to make an Offer (and, if
relevant, a Convertible Offer) under Regulation 26.3, 26.4 or 26.5 or who has made such an offer which
has lapsed, shall observe and shall procure that any persons acting in concert with him shall observe the
