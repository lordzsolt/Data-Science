The Company is authorised to issue a maximum of 100,000,000,000 ordinary shares of
one class with a par value of HK$0.001 each.

Subject to the provisions of these Articles and to any direction that may be given by the
Company in general meeting and without prejudice to any special rights conferred on
the holders of any existing shares or attaching to any class of shares, any share may be
issued with or have attached thereto such preferred, deferred, qualified or other special
rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return applicable to shares
or otherwise, and to such persons at such times and for such consideration as the Board
may determine. Subject to the Act and to any special rights conferred on any members
or attaching to any class of shares, any share may, with the sanction of a Special
Resolution of Members, be issued on terms that it is, or at the option of the Company or
the holder thereof is, liable to be redeemed. No shares shall be issued to bearer.

Subject to the Listing Rules, the Board may issue warrants to subscribe for any class
of shares or other securities of the Company on such terms as it may from time to time
determine. No warrants shall be issued to bearer for so long as a recognised clearing
house (in its capacity as such) is a member of the Company. Where warrants are issued
to bearer, no new warrant shall be issued to replace one that has been lost unless the
Board is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the original has been destroyed and
the Company has received an indemnity in such form as the Board shall think fit with
regard to the issue of any such new warrant.

shares) provided that the manner of purchase has first been authorised by Resolution of
Members, and to purchase or otherwise acquire warrants for the subscription or purchase
of its own shares, and shares and warrants for the subscription or purchase of any

means of a loan, a guarantee, a gift, an indemnity, the provision of security or otherwise

other acquisition made or to be made by any person of any shares or warrants in the
Company or any company which is a holding company of the Company and should the
Company purchase or otherwise acquire its own shares or warrants neither the Company
nor the Board shall be required to select the shares or warrants to be purchased or
otherwise acquired rateably or in any other manner as between the holders of shares
or warrants of the same class or as between them and the holders of shares or warrants
of any other class or in accordance with the rights as to dividends conferred by any

1.10 Where the Company purchases or redeems any of its shares, purchases or redemption

not made through the market or by tender shall be limited to a maximum price, and if
purchases are by tender, tenders shall be available to all members alike.

The purchase or redemption of any share shall not be deemed to give rise to the
purchase or redemption of any other share. Shares that the Company purchases, redeems
or otherwise acquires shall be cancelled, and no shares shall be held as treasury shares
by the Company.

The holder of the shares being purchased, surrendered or redeemed shall be bound to
deliver up to the Company at its principal place of business in Hong Kong or such other
place as the Board shall specify the certificate(s) thereof for cancellation and thereupon
the Company shall pay to him the purchase or redemption monies in respect thereof.

Subject to the provisions of the Act, of the Memorandum, and of these Articles relating
to new shares, the unissued shares in the Company (whether forming part of its original
or any increased authorised shares) shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may
offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such
times, for such consideration, and upon such terms, as the Board shall determine.

The Company may, unless prohibited by law, at any time pay a commission to any
person for subscribing or agreeing to subscribe (whether absolutely or conditionally) for
any shares in the Company or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions (whether
absolute or conditional) for any shares in the Company, but so that the conditions and
requirements of the Act shall be observed and complied with, and in each case the
commission shall not exceed 10% of the price at which the shares are issued.

Except as otherwise expressly provided by these Articles or as required by law or as
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, no person shall be recognised by the
Company as holding any share upon any trust and the Company shall not be bound by or
be compelled in any way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable,
contingent, future or partial interest in any shares or any interest in any fractional part
of a share or any other rights in respect of any share except an absolute right to the
entirety thereof in the registered holder.

The Board shall cause to be kept at such place within or outside the British Virgin
Islands as it deems fit a principal register of the members and there shall be entered
therein the particulars of the members and the shares issued to each of them and other
particulars required under the Act.

If the Board considers it necessary or appropriate, the Company may establish and
maintain a branch register or registers of members at such location or locations within
or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Board thinks fit. The principal register and
the branch register(s) shall together be treated as the register for the purposes of these
Articles.

The Board may, in its absolute discretion, at any time transfer any share upon the
principal register to any branch register or any share on any branch register to the
principal register or any other branch register.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article, the Company shall as soon as
practicable and on a regular basis record in the principal register all transfers of shares
effected on any branch register and shall at all times maintain the principal register
in such manner as to show at all times the members for the time being and the shares
respectively held by them, in all respects in accordance with the Act.

Except when a register is closed and, if applicable, subject to the additional provisions
of Article 2.8, the principal register and any branch register shall during business hours
be kept open to the inspection of any member without charge.

The reference to business hours in Article 2.5 1s subject to such reasonable restrictions
as the Company by Resolution of Members may impose, but so that not less than two
hours in each business day is to be allowed for inspections.

The register may, on 14 days’ notice (or on 6 business days’ notice in the case of a
rights issue) being given by advertisement published on the Exchange’s website, or,
subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the manner in which
notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as herein provided or
by advertisement published in the newspapers, be closed at such times and for such
periods as the Board may from time to time determine, either generally or in respect
of any class of shares, provided that the register shall not be closed for more than 30
days in any year (or such longer period as the members may by Resolution of Members
determine provided that such period shall not be extended beyond 60 days in any year).
The Company shall, on demand, furnish any person seeking to inspect the register or
part thereof which is closed by virtue of these Articles with a certificate under the hand
of the Secretary stating the period for which, and by whose authority, it is closed. In the
event that there is an alteration of book closure dates, the Company shall give at least 5
business days’ notice in accordance with the procedures set out in this Article.

Any register held in Hong Kong shall during normal business hours (subject to such
reasonable restrictions as the Board may impose) be open to inspection by a member
without charge and any other person on payment of such fee not exceeding HK$2.50
(or such higher amount as may from time to time be permitted under the Listing Rules)
as the Board may determine for each inspection. Any member may require a copy of
the register, or any part thereof, on payment of HK$0.25, or such lesser sum as the
Company may prescribe, for every 100 words or fractional part thereof required to be
copied. The Company shall cause any copy so required by any person to be sent to that
person within a period of 10 days commencing on the date next after the day on which
the request is received by the Company.

In lieu of, or apart from, closing the register pursuant to other provisions in these
Article, the Board may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such
determination of members entitled to receive notice of, or to vote at any general meeting
of the members or any adjournment thereof, or for the purpose of determining the
members entitled to receive payment of any dividend or distribution or in order to make
a determination of members for any other purpose.

Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register shall be entitled to
receive, within any relevant time limit as prescribed in the Act or as the Exchange may
from time to time determine, whichever is shorter, and subject to payment of any fees
which may be payable pursuant to Article 5.7, after allotment or lodgment of transfer,
or within such other period as the conditions of issue shall provide, one certificate for
all his shares of each class or, if he shall so request, in a case where the allotment or
transfer is of a number of shares in excess of the number for the time being forming an
Exchange board lot, such numbers of certificates for shares in Exchange board lots or
multiples thereof as he shall request and one for the balance (if any) of the shares in
question, provided that, in respect of a share or shares held jointly by several persons,
the Company shall not be bound to issue a certificate or certificates to each such person
and the issue and delivery of a certificate or certificates to one of several joint holders
shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders. All certificates for shares shall be
delivered personally or sent through the post addressed to the member entitled thereto at
his registered address as appearing in the register.

Every certificate for shares or debentures or representing any other form of security of
the Company shall be issued under the seal of the Company, which shall only be affixed
with the authority of the Board.

Every share certificate shall specify the number and class of shares in respect of which
it is issued and the amount paid thereon or the fact that they are fully paid, as the
case may be, and may otherwise be in such form as the Board may from time to time
prescribe.

The Company shall not be bound to register more than four persons as joint holders
of any share. If any share shall stand in the names of two or more persons, the person
first named in the register shall be deemed the sole holder thereof as regards service
of notices and, subject to the provisions of these Articles, all or any other matters
connected with the Company, except the transfer of the share.

of the old certificate to the Company for cancellation.

The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully
paid up share) for all moneys, whether presently payable or not, called or payable
at a fixed time in respect of such share; and the Company shall also have a first and
paramount lien and charge on all shares (other than fully paid up shares) standing
registered in the name of a member (whether solely or jointly with others) for all the
debts and liabilities of such member or his estate to the Company and whether the same
shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any equitable or other
interest of any person other than such member, and whether the period for the payment
or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the
same are joint debts or liabilities of such member or his estate and any other person,
whether such person is a member of the Company or not.

The Company’s lien (if any) on a share shall extend to all dividends and bonuses
declared in respect thereof. The Board may resolve that any share shall for some
specified period be exempt wholly or partially from the provisions of this Article.

The Company may sell in such manner as the Board thinks fit any shares on which the
Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless some sum in respect of which the
lien exists is presently payable or the liability or engagement in respect of which such
lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or discharged, nor until the expiration of
14 days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently
payable or specifying the liability or engagement and demanding fulfilment or discharge
thereof and giving notice of intention to sell in default, shall have been given to the
registered holder for the time being of the shares or the person, of which the Company
has notice, entitled to the shares by reason of such holder’s death, mental disorder or
bankruptcy.

The net proceeds of such sale by the Company after the payment of the costs of such
sale shall be applied in or towards payment or satisfaction of the debt or liability or
engagement in respect whereof the lien exists, so far as the same is presently payable,
and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable
as existed upon the shares prior to the sale and upon surrender, if required by the
Company, for cancellation of the certificate for the share sold) be paid to the holder
immediately before such sale of the share. For giving effect to any such sale, the Board
may authorise any person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof and may
enter the purchaser’s name in the register as holder of the shares, and the purchaser
shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to
the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to
the sale.

The Board may from time to time make such calls as it may think fit upon the members
in respect of any monies unpaid on the shares held by them respectively (whether on
account of the nominal amount of the shares or by way of premium or otherwise) and
not by the conditions of allotment thereof made payable at fixed times. A call may be
made payable either in one sum or by instalments. A call may be revoked or postponed
as the Board may determine.

At least 14 days’ notice of any call shall be given to each member specifying the time
and place of payment and to whom such payment shall be made.

A copy of the notice referred to in Article 4.2 shall be sent in the manner in which
notices may be sent to members by the Company as herein provided.

Every member upon whom a call is made shall pay the amount of every call so made on
him to the person and at the time or times and place or places as the Board shall specify.
A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable on such call notwithstanding the
subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was made.

In addition to the giving of notice in accordance with Article 4.3, notice of the person
appointed to receive payment of every call and of the times and places appointed for
payment may be given to the members affected by notice published on the Exchange’s
website, or, subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the manner in
which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as herein provided or
by advertisement published in the newspapers.

A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the Resolution of Directors
authorising such call was passed.

The joint holders of a share shall be severally as well as jointly liable for the payment
of all calls and instalments due in respect of such share or other moneys due in respect
thereof.

The Board may from time to time at its discretion extend the time fixed for any call,
and may extend such time as to all or any of the members, whom by reason of residence
outside Hong Kong or other cause the Board considers it reasonable to grant an
extension to, but no member shall be entitled to any such extension as a matter of grace
and favour.

If the sum or any instalment payable in respect of any call is unpaid on or before the
day appointed for payment thereof, the person or persons from whom the sum is due
shall pay interest on the same at such rate not exceeding 15% per annum as the Board
shall determine from the day appointed for the payment thereof to the time of actual
payment, but the Board may waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.

No member shall be entitled to receive any dividend or bonus or to be present and vote
(save as proxy for another member) at any general meeting, either personally or by
proxy, or be reckoned in a quorum, or to exercise any other privilege as a member until
all sums or instalments due from him to the Company in respect of any call, whether
alone or jointly with any other person, together with interest and expenses (if any) shall
have been paid.

money due for any call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the member
sued is entered in the register as the holder, or one of the holders, of the shares in
respect of which such debt accrued; that the Resolution of Directors making the call
is duly recorded in the minute book; and that notice of such call was duly given to the
member sued, in pursuance of these Articles; and it shall not be necessary to prove the
appointment of the Directors who made such call, nor any other matters whatsoever, and
the proof of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.

4.12 Any sum which by the terms of allotment of a share is made payable upon allotment

4.13

or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the share and/or by
way of premium or otherwise, shall for all purposes of these Articles be deemed to be a
call duly made and payable on the date fixed for payment, and in case of non-payment,
all the relevant provisions of these Articles as to payment of interest and expenses,
habilities of joint holders, forfeiture and the like, shall apply as if such sum had become
payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same,
and either in money or money’s worth, all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid
or instalments payable upon any shares held by him, and upon all or any of the moneys
so advanced the Company may pay interest at such rate (if any) as the Board may
decide. The Board may at any time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such
member not less than one month’s notice in writing of its intention in that behalf, unless
before the expiration of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been called up
on the shares in respect of which it was advanced. No such sum paid in advance of
calls shall entitle the member paying such sum to any portion of a dividend declared
in respect of any period prior to the date upon which such sum would, but for such
payment, become presently payable.

5 Transfer of Shares

5.1

5.2

Transfers of shares may be effected by an instrument of transfer in the usual common
form or in such other form as the Board may approve, which is consistent with the
standard form of transfer as prescribed by the Exchange and approved by the Board.
All instruments of transfer must be left at the registered office of the Company or at
such other place as the Board may appoint and all such instruments of transfer shall be
retained by the Company.

The instrument of transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and by or
on behalf of the transferee PROVIDED that the Board may dispense with the execution
of the instrument of transfer by the transferee in any case which it thinks fit in its
discretion to do so. The instrument of transfer of any share shall be in writing and shall
be executed with a manual signature or facsimile signature (which may be machine
imprinted or otherwise) by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee PROVIDED
that in the case of execution by facsimile signature by or on behalf of a transferor
or transferee, the Board shall have previously been provided with a list of specimen
signatures of the authorised signatories of such transferor or transferee and the Board
shall be reasonably satisfied that such facsimile signature corresponds to one of those
specimen signatures. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of a share
until the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect thereof.

The Board may, in its absolute discretion, and without assigning any reason, refuse to
register a transfer of any share which is not fully paid up or on which the Company has
a lien.

If the Board shall refuse to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within two months
after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to each of the
transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.

The Board may also decline to register any transfer of any shares unless:

(a) the instrument of transfer is lodged with the Company accompanied by the
certificate for the shares to which it relates (which shall upon registration of
the transfer be cancelled) and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;

(b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares;

(c) the instrument of transfer is properly stamped (in circumstances where stamping is
required);

(d) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to which the
share is to be transferred does not exceed four;

(e) the shares concerned are free of any lien in favour of the Company; and

(f) a fee of such maximum as the Exchange may from time to time determine to be
payable (or such lesser sum as the Board may from time to time require) is paid to
the Company in respect thereof.

No transfer shall be made to an infant or to a person in respect of whom an order has
been made by any competent court or official on the grounds that he is or may be
suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise incapable of managing his affairs or
under other legal disability.

Upon every transfer of shares, the certificate held by the transferor shall be given up to
be cancelled and shall forthwith be cancelled accordingly and a new certificate shall be
issued, on payment by the transferee of such fee not exceeding the maximum amount
as the Exchange may from time to time determine to be payable or such lesser sum
as the Board may from time to time require, to the transferee in respect of the shares
transferred to him and, if any of the shares included in the certificate so given up shall
be retained by the transferor, a new certificate in respect thereof shall be issued to him,
on payment by the transferor of such fee not exceeding the maximum amount as the
Exchange may from time to time determine to be payable or such lesser sum as the
Board may from time to time require. The Company shall also retain the instrument(s)
of transfer.

The registration of transfers may, on 14 days’ notice (or on 6 business days’ notice in
the case of a rights issue) being given by advertisement published on the Exchange’s
website, or, subject to the Listing Rules, by electronic communication in the manner in
which notices may be served by the Company by electronic means as herein provided
or by advertisement published in the newspapers, be suspended and the register closed
at such times for such periods as the Board may from time to time determine, provided
always that such registration shall not be suspended or the register closed for more
than 30 days in any year (or such longer period as the members may by Resolution of
Members determine provided that such period shall not be extended beyond 60 days in
any year). In the event that there is an alteration of book closure dates, the Company
shall give at least 5 business days’ notice before the announced closure, or the new
closure, whichever is earlier. If, however, there are exceptional circumstances (e.g.
during a Number 8 or higher typhoon signal and black rainstorm warning) that render
the giving of such publication of advertisement impossible, the Company shall comply
with these requirements as soon as practicable.

In the case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a
joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased where he was a sole
holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his
interest in the shares; but nothing herein contained shall release the estate of a deceased
holder (whether sole or joint) from any liability in respect of any share solely or jointly
held by him.

Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy
or winding-up of a member may, upon such evidence as to his title being produced as
may from time to time be required by the Board and subject as hereinafter provided,
either be registered himself as holder of the share or elect to have some other person
nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof.

If the person so becoming entitled shall elect to be registered himself, he shall deliver
or send to the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If
he shall elect to have his nominee registered he shall testify his election by executing
in favour of his nominee a transfer of such share. All the limitations, restrictions and
provisions of these Articles relating to the right to transfer and the registration of
transfers of shares shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if
the death or bankruptcy or winding-up of the member had not occurred and the notice
or transfer were a transfer executed by such member.

A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy or winding-
up of the holder shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which
he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share. However, the Board
may, if it thinks fit, withhold the payment of any dividend payable or other advantages
in respect of such share until such person shall become the registered holder of the
share or shall have effectually transferred such share, but, subject to the requirements of
Article 12.3 being met, such a person may vote at meetings.

If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for
payment thereof, the Board may, at any time during such time as any part thereof
remains unpaid, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 4.10, serve a notice on
him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with
any interest which may have accrued and which may still accrue up to the date of actual
payment.

The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from
the date of service of the notice) on or before which, and the place where, the payment
required by the notice is to be made, and shall state that in the event of non-payment
at or before the time and at the place appointed, the shares in respect of which the call
was made or instalment is unpaid will be liable to be forfeited. The Board may accept
a surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder and in such case, references in
these Articles to forfeiture shall include surrender.

If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not complied with, any share
in respect of which the notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the
payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board
to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends and bonuses declared in respect
of the forfeited share, and not actually paid before the forfeiture.

Any share so forfeited shall be deemed to be the property of the Company, and may be
re-allotted sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Board
thinks fit and at any time before a re-allotment, sale or disposition the forfeiture may be
cancelled by the Board on such terms as it thinks fit.

A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of
the forfeited shares but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the Company all
moneys which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by him to the Company in respect
of the shares, together with (if the Board shall in its discretion so require) interest
thereon from the date of forfeiture until payment at such rate not exceeding 15% per
annum as the Board may prescribe, and the Board may enforce the payment thereof if it
thinks fit, and without any deduction or allowance for the value of the shares forfeited,
at the date of forfeiture. For the purposes of this Article any sum which, by the terms
of issue of a share, is payable thereon at a fixed time which is subsequent to the date of
forfeiture, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium,
shall notwithstanding that time has not yet arrived, be deemed to be payable at the
date of forfeiture, and the same shall become due and payable immediately upon the
forfeiture, but interest thereon shall only be payable in respect of any period between
the said fixed time and the date of actual payment.

A statutory declaration in writing that the declarant is a Director or Secretary, and that
a share in the Company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declaration, shall
be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons claiming to be
entitled to the share. The Company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the
share on any re-allotment, sale or disposition thereof and the Board may authorise any
person to execute a letter of re-allotment or transfer the share in favour of the person to
whom the share is re-allotted, sold or disposed of and he shall thereupon be registered
as the holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the
subscription or purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, re-allotment,
sale or other disposal of the share.

When any share shall have been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be given to the
member in whose name it stood immediately prior to the forfeiture, and an entry of the
forfeiture, with the date thereof, shall forthwith be made in the register. Notwithstanding
the above, no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect
to give such notice as aforesaid.

Notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid, the Board may at any time, before any
share so forfeited shall have been re-allotted, sold, or otherwise disposed of, permit the
share forfeited to be redeemed upon the terms of payment of all calls and interest due
upon and expenses incurred in respect of the share, and upon such further terms (if any)
as it thinks fit.

The forfeiture of a share shall not prejudice the right of the Company to any call already
made or instalment payable thereon.

7.10 The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment

of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time,
whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the
same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

Alteration of Shares

8.1

8.2

The Company may from time to time by Resolution of Members cancel any shares
which at the date of the passing of the Resolution of Members have not been taken or
agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the maximum number of shares the
Company is authorised to issue by the number of the shares so cancelled subject to the
provisions of the Act.

The Company may from time to time by Resolution of Members and in accordance with
the Act, the Memorandum and the Articles:

(a) divide its shares, including issued shares, into a larger number of shares; or
(b) combine its shares, including issued shares, into a smaller number of shares,
provided that, where shares are divided or combined, the aggregate par value (if any) of
the new shares must be equal to the aggregate par value (if any) of the original shares,

and the Company shall not divide its shares if it would cause the maximum number of
shares that the Company is authorised to issue by its Memorandum to be exceeded.

Borrowing Powers

The Board may from time to time at its discretion exercise all the powers of the

the purposes of the Company and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and
assets (present and future) and uncalled amounts owing on the shares in the Company or
any part thereof.

The Board may raise or secure the payment or repayment of such sum or sums in
such manner and upon such terms and conditions in all respects as it thinks fit and, in
particular, by the issue of debentures, debenture stock, bonds or other securities of the
Company, whether outright or as collateral security for any debts, liability or obligations
of the Company or of any third party.

The Board shall cause a proper register to be kept, in accordance with the provisions of
the Act, of all mortgages and charges specifically affecting the property of the Company
and shall duly comply with the requirements of the Act in regard to the registration of
mortgages and charges therein specified and otherwise.

If the Company issues debentures or debenture stock (whether as part of a series or
as individual instruments) not transferable by delivery, the Board shall cause a proper
register to be kept of the holders of such debentures.

Where any uncalled sums owing on the shares in the Company is charged, all persons
taking any subsequent charge thereon shall take the same subject to such prior charge,
and shall not be entitled, by notice to the members or otherwise, to obtain priority over
such prior charge.

General Meetings

10.1

The Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting
in addition to any other meeting in that year and shall specify the meeting as such in
the notices calling it; and not more than 15 months shall elapse (or such longer period
as the Exchange may authorise) between the date of one annual general meeting of
the Company and that of the next. So long as the first annual general meeting of the
Company is held within 18 months of its incorporation, it need not be held in the year
of its incorporation or in the following year. The annual general meeting shall be held at
such time and place as the Board shall appoint.

10.2 All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called extraordinary

10.3

general meetings.

The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, convene an extraordinary general meeting.
General meetings shall also be convened on the written requisition of any two or more
members of the Company deposited at the principal office of the Company in Hong
Kong or, in the event the Company ceases to have such a principal office, the registered
office specifying the objects of the meeting and signed by the requisitionists, provided
that such requisitionists held as at the date of deposit of the requisition not less than
one-tenth of the nominal value of the issued shares in the Company which carries the
right of voting at general meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be
convened on the written requisition of any one member of the Company which is a
recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) deposited at the principal office of the
Company in Hong Kong or, in the event the Company ceases to have such a principal
office, the registered office specifying the objects of the meeting and signed by the
requisitionist, provided that such requisitionist held as at the date of deposit of the
requisition not less than one-tenth of the nominal value of the issued shares in the
Company which carries the right of voting at general meetings of the Company. If
the Board does not within 21 days from the date of deposit of the requisition proceed
duly to convene the meeting to be held within a further 21 days, the requisitionist(s)
themselves or any of them representing more than one-half of the total voting rights of

of the requisition, and all reasonable expenses incurred by the requisitionist(s) as a
result of the failure of the Board shall be reimbursed to them by the Company.

10.5

10.6

10.7

10.8

of a Special Resolution of Members shall be called by not less than 21 days’ notice in
writing and any other extraordinary general meeting shall be called by not less than 14
days’ notice in writing. Subject to the requirement under the Listing Rules, the notice
shall be inclusive of the day on which it is served or deemed to be served and of the
day for which it is given, and shall specify the time, place, and agenda of the meeting,
particulars of the resolutions to be considered at the meeting and in the case of special
business (as defined in Article 11.1) the general nature of that business. The notice
convening an annual general meeting shall specify the meeting as such, and the notice
convening a meeting to pass a Special Resolution of Members shall specify the intention
to propose the resolution as a Special Resolution of Members. Notice of every general
meeting shall be given to the Auditors and to all members other than such as, under the
provisions hereof or the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive
such notice from the Company.

Notwithstanding that a meeting of the Company is called by shorter notice than that
referred to in Article 10.4, it shall be deemed to have been duly called if it is so agreed:

(a) in the case of a meeting called as an annual general meeting, by all the members
of the Company entitled to attend and vote thereat or their proxies; and

(b) inthe case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the members having a
right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less
than 95% in nominal value of the shares giving that right.

There shall appear with reasonable prominence in every notice of general meetings of
the Company a statement that a member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint
a proxy to attend and vote instead of him and that a proxy need not be a member of the
Company.

The accidental omission to give any such notice to, or the non-receipt of any such notice
by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any
proceeding at any such meeting.

In cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with notices, the accidental omission
to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such instrument of proxy by,
any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any
proceeding at any such meeting.

Proceedings at General Meetings

11.1

All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an extraordinary general
meeting and also all business shall be deemed special that is transacted at an annual
general meeting with the exception of the following, which shall be deemed ordinary
business:

(a) the declaration and sanctioning of dividends;

(b) the consideration and adoption of the accounts and balance sheets and the reports
of the Directors and Auditors and other documents required to be annexed to the
balance sheet;

(c) the election of Directors in place of those retiring;
(d) the appointment of Auditors;

(e) the fixing of, or the determining of the method of fixing of, the remuneration of
the Directors and of the Auditors;

(f) the granting of any mandate or authority to the Directors to offer, allot, grant
options over, or otherwise dispose of the unissued shares of the Company
representing not more than 20% (or such other percentage as may from time to
time be specified in the Listing Rules) in nominal value of its then existing issued
shares and the number of any securities repurchased pursuant to Article 11.1(g);
and

(g) the granting of any mandate or authority to the Directors to repurchase securities
of the Company.

For all purposes the quorum for a general meeting shall be two members present in
person (or in the case of a corporation, by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy
provided always that if the Company has only one member of record the quorum shall
be that one member present in person or by proxy. No business (except the appointment
of a Chairman) shall be transacted at any general meeting unless the requisite quorum
shall be present at the commencement of the business.

If within 15 minutes from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present,
the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of members, shall be dissolved, but in any
other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in the next week and at such time
and place as shall be decided by the Board, and if at such adjourned meeting a quorum
is not present within 15 minutes from the time appointed for holding the meeting, the
member or members present in person (or in the case of a corporation, by its duly
authorised representative) or by proxy shall be a quorum and may transact the business
for which the meeting was called.

The Chairman shall take the chair at every general meeting, or, if there be no such
Chairman or, if at any general meeting such Chairman shall not be present within 15
minutes after the time appointed for holding such meeting or is unwilling to act, the
Directors present shall choose another Director as Chairman, and if no Director be
present, or if all the Directors present decline to take the chair, or if the Chairman

chosen shall retire from the chair, then the members present (whether in person or
represented by proxy or duly authorised representative) shall choose one of their own
number to be Chairman.

The Chairman may, with the consent of any general meeting at which a quorum is
present, and shall, if so directed by the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to
time and from place to place as the meeting shall determine. Whenever a meeting is
adjourned for 14 days or more, at least seven clear days’ notice, specifying the place,
the day and the hour of the adjourned meeting shall be given in the same manner as in
the case of an original meeting but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice
the nature of the business to be transacted at the adjourned meeting. Save as aforesaid,
no member shall be entitled to any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be
transacted at any adjourned meeting. No business shall be transacted at any adjourned
meeting other than the business which might have been transacted at the meeting from
which the adjournment took place.

At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a
poll save that the Chairman may, in good faith, allow a resolution which relates purely
to a procedural or administrative matter as prescribed under the Listing Rules to be
voted on by a show of hands.

A poll shall (subject as provided in Article 11.8) be taken in such manner (including
the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) and at such time and place, not being more
than 30 days from the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the poll was
taken as the Chairman directs. No notice need be given of a poll not taken immediately.
The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the
poll was taken.

Any poll on the election of a Chairman of a meeting or any question of adjournment
shall be taken at the meeting and without adjournment.

Where a resolution is voted on by a show of hands as permitted under the Listing Rules,
a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously,
or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the minute book of
the Company shall be conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the number or
proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.

11.10 In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a poll or on a show of hands, the

Chairman of the meeting at which the poll or show of hands is taken shall be entitled to
a second or casting vote.

11.11 A Written Resolution (in one or more counterparts), including a Special Resolution of

Members, signed by all members for the time being entitled to receive notice of and
to attend and vote at general meetings (or being corporations by their duly appointed
representatives) shall be as valid and effective as if the same had been passed at a
general meeting of the Company duly convened and held. Any such resolution shall be
deemed to have been passed at a meeting held on the date on which it was signed by the
last member to sign.

Subject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to voting for the time being
attached to any class or classes of shares, at any general meeting where a show of
hands is allowed, every member present in person (or, in the case of a member being
a corporation, by its duly authorised representative) shall have one vote, and on a poll
every member present in person (or, in the case of a member being a corporation, by its
duly authorised representative) or by proxy shall have one vote for each share registered
in his name in the register. On a poll a member entitled to more than one vote is under
no obligation to cast all his votes in the same way. For the avoidance of doubt, where
more than one proxy is appointed by a recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)),
each such proxy shall have one vote on a show of hands and is under no obligation to
cast all his votes in the same way on a poll.

Where any member is, under the Listing Rules, required to abstain from voting on
any particular resolution or restricted to voting only for or only against any particular
resolution, any votes cast by or on behalf of such member in contravention of such
requirement or restriction shall not be counted.

12.3 Any person entitled under Article 6.2 to be registered as a member may vote at any

general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were the registered
holder of such shares, provided that at least 48 hours before the time of the holding of
the meeting or adjourned meeting (as the case may be) at which he proposed to vote,
he shall satisfy the Board of his right to be registered as the holder of such shares or
the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote at such meeting in respect
thereof.

12.4 Where there are joint registered holders of any share, any one of such persons may vote

at any meeting, either personally or by proxy, in respect of such share as if he were
solely entitled thereto; but if more than one of such joint holders be present at any
meeting personally or by proxy, that one of the said persons so present being the most
or, as the case may be, the more senior shall alone be entitled to vote in respect of the
relevant joint holding and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by reference
to the order in which the names of the joint holders stand on the register in respect of
the relevant joint holding. Several executors or administrators of a deceased member
in whose name any share stands shall for the purposes of this Article be deemed joint
holders thereof.

12.5 A member in respect of whom an order has been made by any competent court or

12.6

official on the grounds that he is or may be suffering from mental disorder or is
otherwise incapable of managing his affairs may vote by any person authorised in such
circumstances to do so, and such person may vote by proxy.

Save as expressly provided in these Articles or as otherwise determined by the Board,
no person other than a member duly registered and who shall have paid all sums for
the time being due from him payable to the Company in respect of his shares shall be
entitled to be present or to vote (save as proxy for another member), or to be reckoned
in a quorum, either personally or by proxy at any general meeting.

or adjourned meeting at which the person exercising or purporting to exercise his vote
or the vote objected to is given or tendered, and every vote not disallowed at such
meeting shall be valid for all purposes. In the case of any dispute as to the admission or
rejection of any vote, the Chairman of the meeting shall determine the same and such
determination shall be final and conclusive.

12.8 Any member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company

12.9

shall be entitled to appoint another person (who must be an individual) as his proxy to
attend and vote instead of him and a proxy so appointed shall have the same right as
the member to speak at the meeting. Votes may be given either personally or by proxy.
A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member may appoint any number of
proxies to attend in his stead at any one general meeting (or at any one class meeting).

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or
of his attorney authorised in writing, or if the appointor is a corporation, either under its
seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person duly authorised to sign the
same.

12.10 The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Board) the power of attorney

12.11

or other authority, (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of
such power or authority, shall be delivered at the registered office of the Company
(or at such other place as may be specified in the notice convening the meeting or in
any notice of any adjournment or, in either case, in any document sent therewith) not
less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned
meeting at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote, or, in the case
of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not less
than 48 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll, and in default the
instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid provided always that the Chairman of
the meeting may at his discretion direct that an instrument of proxy shall be deemed to
have been duly deposited upon receipt of telex or cable or facsimile confirmation from
the appointor that the instrument of proxy duly signed is in the course of transmission
to the Company. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration
of 12 months from the date named in it as the date of its execution. Delivery of any
instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting in
person at the meeting or poll concerned and, in such event, the instrument appointing a
proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.

Every instrument of proxy, whether for a specified meeting or otherwise, shall be in
common form or such other form that complies with the Listing Rules as the Board
may from time to time approve, provided that it shall enable a member, according
to his intention, to instruct his proxy to vote in favour of or against (or in default of
instructions or in the event of conflicting instructions, to exercise his discretion in
respect of) each resolution to be proposed at the meeting to which the form of proxy
relates.

12.12 The instrument appointing a proxy to vote at a general meeting shall: (a) be deemed

to confer authority to vote on any amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for
which it is given as the proxy thinks fit; and (b) unless the contrary is stated therein, be
valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates,
provided that the meeting was originally held within 12 months from such date.

or the transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy was given, provided that no

of shares of the Company and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the

exercise if it were an individual member of the Company and where a corporation is so
represented, it shall be treated as being present at any meeting in person.

12.15 If a recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) 1s a member of the Company it may

authorise such person or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative(s) at any
general meeting of the Company or at any general meeting of any class of members of
the Company provided that, if more than one person is so authorised, the authorisation
shall specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such person is
so authorised. The person so authorised will be deemed to have been duly authorised
without the need of producing any documents of title, notarised authorisation and/or
further evidence to substantiate that it is so authorised. A person so authorised pursuant
to this provision shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and powers on behalf of
the recognised clearing house (or its nominee(s)) which he represents as that recognised
clearing house (or its nominee(s)) could exercise as if such person were an individual
member of the Company holding the number and class of shares specified in such
authorisation, including, where a show of hands is allowed, the right to vote individually
on a show of hands, notwithstanding any contrary provision contained in these Articles.

office of Director at any general meeting unless during the period, which shall be at
least seven days, commencing no earlier than the day after the despatch of the notice
of the meeting appointed for such election and ending no later than seven days prior to
the date of such meeting, there has been given to the Secretary notice in writing by a
member of the Company (not being the person to be proposed), entitled to attend and
vote at the meeting for which such notice is given, of his intention to propose such
person for election and also notice in writing signed by the person to be proposed of his
willingness to be elected.

The Company shall keep at its office a register of Directors containing their names and

(including a Managing Director or other executive Director) before the expiration of his
period of office notwithstanding anything in these Articles or in any agreement between
the Company and such Director and may by Resolution of Members elect another
person in his stead. Any person so elected shall hold office during such time only as
the Director in whose place he is elected would have held the same if he had not been
removed. Nothing in this Article should be taken as depriving a Director removed under
any provisions of this Article of compensation or damages payable to him in respect
of the termination of his appointment as Director or of any other appointment or office
as a result of the termination of his appointment as Director or as derogatory from any
power to remove a Director which may exist apart from the provision of this Article.

14.7 A Director may at any time by notice in writing delivered to the registered office of

14.8

14.9

the Company, the principal office of the Company in Hong Kong or at a meeting of
the Board, appoint any person (including another Director) to be his alternate Director
in his place during his absence and may in like manner at any time determine such
appointment. Such appointment, unless previously approved by the Board, shall have
effect only upon and subject to being so approved, provided that the Board may not
withhold approval of any such appointment where the proposed appointee is a Director.

The appointment of an alternate Director shall determine on the happening of any event
which, were he a Director, would cause him to vacate such office or if his appointor
ceases to be a Director.

An alternate Director shall (except when absent from Hong Kong), be entitled to receive
and waive (in lieu of his appointor) notices of meetings of the Directors and shall be
entitled to attend and vote as a Director and be counted in the quorum at any such
meeting at which the Director appointing him is not personally present and generally
at such meeting to perform all the functions of his appointor as a Director and for the
purposes of the proceedings at such meeting the provisions of these Articles shall apply
as if he (instead of his appointor) were a Director. If he shall be himself a Director
or shall attend any such meeting as an alternate for more than one Director his voting
rights shall be cumulative and he need not use all his votes or cast all the votes he
uses in the same way. If his appointor is for the time being absent from Hong Kong

or otherwise not available or unable to act (as to which a certificate by the alternate
shall in the absence of actual notice to the contrary to other Directors be conclusive),
his signature to any resolution in writing of the Directors shall be as effective as the
signature of his appointor. To such extent as the Board may from time to time determine
in relation to any committee of the Board, the provisions of this Article shall also
apply mutatis mutandis to any meeting of any such committee of which his appointor
is a member. An alternate Director shall not, save as aforesaid, have power to act as a
Director nor shall he be deemed to be a Director for the purposes of these Articles.

14.10 An alternate Director shall be entitled to contract and be interested in and benefit

14.11

from contracts or arrangements or transactions and to be repaid expenses and to be
indemnified to the same extent mutatis mutandis as if he were a Director, but he shall
not be entitled to receive from the Company in respect of his appointment as alternate
Director any remuneration except only such part (if any) of the remuneration otherwise
payable to his appointor as such appointor may by notice in writing to the Company
from time to time direct.

In addition to the provisions of Articles 14.7 to 14.10, a Director may be represented at
any meeting of the Board (or of any committee of the Board) by a proxy appointed by
him, in which event the presence or vote of the proxy shall for all purposes be deemed
to be that of the Director. A proxy need not himself be a Director and the provisions of
Articles 12.8 to 12.13 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the appointment of proxies by
Directors save that an instrument appointing a proxy shall not become invalid after the
expiration of twelve months from its date of execution but shall remain valid for such
period as the instrument shall provide or, if no such provision is made in the instrument,
until revoked in writing and save also that a Director may appoint any number of
proxies although only one such proxy may attend in his stead at meetings of the Board
(or of any committee of the Board).

14.12 A Director need not hold any qualification shares. No Director shall be required to

14.13

vacate office or be ineligible for re-election or re-appointment as a Director and no
person shall be ineligible for appointment as a Director by reason only of his having
attained any particular age.

The Directors shall be entitled to receive by way of remuneration for their services such
sum as shall from time to time be determined by the Company in general meeting or by
the Board, as the case may be, such sum (unless otherwise directed by the resolution by
which it is determined) to be divided amongst the Directors in such proportions and in
such manner as they may agree, or failing agreement, equally, except that in such event
any Director holding office for less than the whole of the relevant period in respect of
which the remuneration is paid shall only rank in such division in proportion to the time
during such period for which he has held office. Such remuneration shall be in addition
to any other remuneration to which a Director who holds any salaried employment or
office in the Company may be entitled by reason of such employment or office.

14.14 Payment to any Director or past Director of any sum by way of compensation for loss

of office or as consideration for or in connection with his retirement from office (not
being a payment to which the Director is contractually entitled) must first be approved
by Resolution of Members.

Directors including their expenses of travelling to and from Board meetings, committee
meetings or general meetings or otherwise incurred whilst engaged on the business of
the Company or in the discharge of their duties as Directors.

14.16 The Board may grant special remuneration to any Director, who shall perform any

special or extra services at the request of the Company. Such special remuneration
may be made payable to such Director in addition to or in substitution for his ordinary
remuneration as a Director, and may be made payable by way of salary, commission or
participation in profits or otherwise as may be agreed.

14.17 The remuneration of an Executive Director (as appointed according to Article 15.1)

or a Director appointed to any other office in the management of the Company shall
from time to time be fixed by the Board and may be by way of salary, commission,
or participation in profits or otherwise or by all or any of those modes and with such
other benefits (including share option and/or pension and/or gratuity and/or other
benefits on retirement) and allowances as the Board may from time to time decide. Such
remuneration shall be in addition to such remuneration as the recipient may be entitled
to receive as a Director.

14.18 The office of a Director shall be vacated:

(a) if he resigns his office by notice in writing to the Company at its registered office
or its principal office in Hong Kong;

(b) if an order is made by any competent court or official on the grounds that he is or
may be suffering from mental disorder or is otherwise incapable of managing his
affairs and the Board resolves that his office be vacated;

(c) if, without leave, he is absent from meetings of the Board (unless an alternate
Director appointed by him attends in his place) for a continuous period of 12

months, and the Board resolves that his office be vacated;

(d) if he becomes bankrupt or has a receiving order made against him or suspends
payment or compounds with his creditors generally;

(e) if he ceases to be or is prohibited from being a Director by law or by virtue of any
provisions in these Articles;

(f) if he shall be removed from office by notice in writing served upon him signed by
not less than three-fourths in number (or, if that is not a round number, the nearest

lower round number) of the Directors (including himself) then in office; or

being (or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest
to, but not less than, one-third) shall retire from office by rotation provided that every
Director (including those appointed for a specific term) shall be subject to retirement by
rotation at least once every three years. Any Director appointed pursuant to Article 14.2
or Article 14.3 shall not be taken into account in determining which Directors are to
retire by rotation. A retiring Director shall retain office until the close of the meeting at
which he retires and shall be eligible for re-election thereat. The Company at any annual
general meeting at which any Directors retire may fill the vacated office by electing a
like number of persons to be Directors.

14.20 No Director or proposed Director shall be disqualified by his office from contracting

14.21

with the Company either as vendor, purchaser or otherwise nor shall any such contract
or any contract or arrangement entered into by or on behalf of the Company with
any person, company or partnership of or in which any Director shall be a member
or otherwise interested be capable on that account of being avoided, nor shall any
Director so contracting or being any member or so interested be liable to account to the
Company for any profit so realised by any such contract or arrangement by reason only
of such Director holding that office or the fiduciary relationship thereby established,
provided that such Director shall, if his interest in such contract or arrangement is
material, declare the nature of his interest at the earliest meeting of the Board at which
it is practicable for him to do so, either specifically or by way of a general notice stating
that, by reason of the facts specified in the notice, he is to be regarded as interested
in any contracts of a specified description which may subsequently be made by the
Company. For the purpose of this Article, such a disclosure is deemed not to have been
made to the Board unless it is made or brought to the attention of every Director.

Any Director may continue to be or become a director, managing director, joint
managing director, deputy managing director, executive director, manager or other
officer or member of any other company in which the Company may be interested and
(unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Director) no such Director
shall be lable to account to the Company or the members for any remuneration or
other benefits received by him as a director, managing director, joint managing director,
deputy managing director, executive director, manager or other officer or member of
any such other company. The Directors may exercise the voting powers conferred by
the shares in any other company held or owned by the Company, or exercisable by
them as directors of such other company in such manner in all respects as they think
fit (¢ncluding the exercise thereof in favour of any resolution appointing themselves or
any of them directors, managing directors, joint managing directors, deputy managing
directors, executive directors, managers or other officers of such company) and any
Director may vote in favour of the exercise of such voting rights in manner aforesaid
notwithstanding that he may be, or is about to be, appointed a director, managing
director, joint managing director, deputy managing director, executive director, manager
or other officer of such a company, and that as such he is or may become interested in
the exercise of such voting rights in the manner aforesaid.

14.22 A Director may hold any other office or place of profit with the Company (except

that of Auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and upon
such terms as the Board may determine, and may be paid such extra remuneration
therefor (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in profit or otherwise)
as the Board may determine, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any
remuneration provided for by or pursuant to any other Article.

jointly under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;

(b) any proposal concerning an offer of shares or debentures or other securities of

be interested in for subscription or purchase where the Director or any of his
Associates is/are or is/are to be interested as a participant in the underwriting or

or any of its subsidiaries including:

any share incentive scheme or share option scheme under which the Director
or any of his Associates may benefit; or

(ii) the adoption, modification or operation of a pension or provident fund
or retirement, death or disability benefits scheme which relates both to
Directors, their Associates and employees of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and does not provide in respect of any Director or any of his
Associates as such any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the
class of persons to which such scheme or fund relates; and

(d) any contract or arrangement in which the Director or any of his Associates is/
are interested in the same manner as other holders of shares or debentures or
other securities of the Company by virtue only of his/their interest in shares or

Executive Director and/or such other employment or executive office in the management
of the business of the Company as it may decide for such period and upon such terms as
it thinks fit and upon such terms as to remuneration as it may decide in accordance with
Article 14.17.

Every Director appointed to an office under Article 15.1 hereof shall, without prejudice
to any claim for damages that such Director may have against the Company or the
Company may have against such Director for any breach of any contract of service
between him and the Company, be liable to be dismissed or removed therefrom by the
Board.

A Director appointed to an office under Article 15.1 shall be subject to the same
provisions as to removal as the other Directors, and he shall, without prejudice to any
claim for damages that such Director may have against the Company or the Company
may have against such Director for any breach of any contract of service between him
and the Company, ipso facto and immediately cease to hold such office if he shall cease
to hold the office of Director for any cause.

The Board may from time to time entrust to and confer upon a Managing Director, Joint
Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director or Executive Director all or any of the
powers of the Board that it may think fit. But the exercise of all powers by such Director
shall be subject to such regulations and restrictions as the Board may from time to time
make and impose, and the said powers may at any time be withdrawn, revoked or varied
but no person dealing in good faith and without notice of such withdrawal, revocation or
variation shall be affected thereby.

Subject to any exercise by the Board of the powers conferred by Articles 17.1 to 17.3,
the management of the business of the Company shall be vested in the Board which,
in addition to the powers and authorities by these Articles expressly conferred upon it,
may exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or
done or approved by the Company and are not hereby or by the Act expressly directed
or required to be exercised or done by the Company in general meeting, but subject
nevertheless to the provisions of the Act and of these Articles and to any regulation
from time to time made by the Company in general meeting not being inconsistent with
such provisions or these Articles, provided that no regulation so made shall invalidate
any prior act of the Board which would have been valid if such regulation had not been
made.

Without prejudice to the general powers conferred by these Articles, it is hereby
expressly declared that the Board shall have the following powers:

(a) to give to any person the right or option of requiring at a future date that an
allotment shall be made to him of any share at par or at such premium as may be
agreed; and

(b) to give to any Directors, officers or employees of the Company an interest in any
particular business or transaction or participation in the profits thereof or in the
general profits of the Company either in addition to or in substitution for a salary
or other remuneration.

Except as would, if the Company were a company incorporated in Hong Kong, be
permitted by Section 157H of the Companies Ordinance as in force at the date of
adoption of these Articles, and except as permitted under the Act, the Company shall
not directly or indirectly:

(a) make a loan to a Director or his Associates or a director of any holding company
of the Company;

(b) enter into any guarantee or provide any security in connection with a loan made by
any person to a Director or such a director; or

(c) if any one or more of the Directors hold (jointly or severally or directly or

The Board may meet together for the despatch of business, adjourn and otherwise
regulate its meetings and proceedings as it thinks fit in any part of the world and may
determine the quorum necessary for the transaction of business. Unless otherwise
determined two Directors shall be a quorum. For the purposes of this Article an alternate
Director shall be counted in a quorum in place of the Director who appointed him and
an alternate Director who is an alternate for more than one Director shall for quorum
purposes be counted separately in respect of himself (if he is a Director) and in respect
of each Director for whom he is an alternate (but so that nothing in this provision
shall be construed as authorising a meeting to be constituted when only one person is
physically present). A meeting of the Board or any committee of the Board may be held
by means of a telephone or tele-conferencing or any other telecommunications facility
provided that all participants are thereby able to communicate contemporaneously by
voice with all other participants and participation in a meeting pursuant to this provision
shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

A Director may, and on request of a Director the Secretary shall, at any time summon
a meeting of the Board. Failing any determination by the Board, not less than 48 hours
notice thereof shall be given to each Director either in writing or by telephone or by
facsimile, telex or telegram at the address or telephone, facsimile or telex number from
time to time notified to the Company by such Director or in such other manner as the
Board may from time to time determine.

Subject to Articles 14.20 to 14.25, questions arising at any meeting of the Board shall
be decided by a majority of votes, and in case of an equality of votes the Chairman shall
have a second or casting vote.

The Board may elect a Chairman of its meetings and determine the period for which he
is to hold office; but if no such Chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the Chairman
is not present within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the same, the
Directors present may choose one of their number to be Chairman of the meeting.

A meeting of the Board for the time being at which a quorum is present shall be

competent to exercise all or any of the authorities, powers and discretions by or under
these Articles for the time being vested in or exercisable by the Board generally.

the appointment of and discharge any committees either wholly or in part, and either
as to persons or purposes, but every committee so formed shall in the exercise of the

like force and effect as if done by the Board, and the Board shall have power, with the
consent of the Company in general meeting, to remunerate the members of any such
committee, and charge such remuneration to the current expenses of the Company.

The meetings and proceedings of any such committee consisting of two or more
members of the Board shall be governed by the provisions herein contained for
regulating the meetings and proceedings of the Board so far as the same are applicable
thereto and are not replaced by any regulations imposed by the Board pursuant to
Article 18.6.

The Board shall cause minutes to be made of:
(a) all appointments of officers made by the Board;

(b) the names of the Directors present at each meeting of the Board and of committees
appointed pursuant to Article 18.6;

(c) all declarations made or notices given by any Director of his interest in any
contract or proposed contract or of his holding of any office or property whereby
any conflict of duty or interest may arise; and

(d) all resolutions and proceedings at all meetings of the Company and of the Board
and of such committees.

18.10 Any such minutes shall be conclusive evidence of any such proceedings if they purport

to be signed by the chairman of the meeting or by the chairman of the succeeding

such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a Director or member of
such committee as the case may be.

18.12 The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but, if

and so long as their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these
Articles as the necessary quorum of Directors, the continuing Director or Directors
may act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to that number or of
summoning a general meeting of the Company but for no other purpose.

convened and held and may consist of several documents in like form each signed by

a resolution in writing shall not be valid and effective if the resolution relates to any
matter or business in which a substantial shareholder of the Company (as defined in the

be done by or to the Secretary, if the office is vacant or there is for any other reason
no Secretary capable of acting, may be done by or to any assistant or deputy Secretary
appointed by the Board, or if there is no assistant or deputy Secretary capable of acting,
by or to any officer of the Company authorised generally or specifically in that behalf
by the Board.

A provision of the Act or of these Articles requiring or authorising a thing to be done

same person acting both as Director and as or in place of the Secretary.

The Board shall provide for the safe custody of the seal which shall only be used by
the authority of the Board or of a committee of the Board authorised by the Board in
that behalf, and every instrument to which such seal shall be affixed shall be signed by
a Director and shall be countersigned by the Secretary or by a second Director or by
some other person appointed by the Board for the purpose. The securities seal which
shall be a facsimile of the common seal with the word “Securities” engraved thereon

Application of Reserves

21.1 The Company in general meeting may, upon the recommendation of the Board, by

Resolution of Members resolve that it is desirable to apply all or any part of the amount
for the time being standing to the credit of any of the Company’s reserve accounts
or funds or to the credit of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for
distribution (and not required for the payment or provision of dividend on any shares
with a preferential right to dividend) and accordingly that such sums be set free for
distribution amongst the members who would have been entitled thereto if distributed
by way of dividend and in the same proportion on condition that the same be not paid
in cash but be applied either in or towards paying up any amounts for the time being
unpaid on any shares held by such members respectively or paying up in full unissued
shares, debentures or other securities of the Company to be allotted and distributed
credited as fully paid up to and amongst such members in proportion aforesaid or partly
in one way and partly in the other, and the Board shall give effect to such resolution,
provided that any account nor reserve or fund of the Company may, for the purposes of
this Article, only be applied in paying up unissued shares to be issued to members of
the Company as fully paid up shares or paying up calls or instalments due or payable on
partly paid securities of the Company subject always to the provisions of the Act.

21.2 Wherever such a resolution as referred to in Article 21.1 shall have been passed the

Board shall make all appropriations and applications resolved to be applied thereby, and
all allotments and issues of fully paid up shares, debentures or other securities, if any,
and generally shall do all acts and things required to give effect thereto, with full power
to the Board:

(a) to make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by payment in
cash or otherwise (including provisions whereby, in whole or in part, fractional
entitlements are aggregated and sold and the net proceeds distributed to those
entitled, or are disregarded or rounded up or down or whereby the benefit of
fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than to the members
concerned) as they think fit in cases where shares, debentures or other securities
become distributable in fractions;

(b) to exclude the right of participation or entitlement of any member with a registered
address outside any territory where in the absence of a registration statement or
other special or onerous formalities the circulation of an offer of such right or
entitlement would or might be unlawful or where the Board consider the costs,
expense or possible delays in ascertaining the existence or extent of the legal and
other requirements applicable to such offer or the acceptance of such offer out of
proportion to the benefits of the Company; and

credited as fully paid up, of any further shares, debentures or other securities to
which they may be entitled upon such application, or, as the case may require, for
the payment up by the Company on their behalf, by the application thereto of their
respective proportions of the profits resolved to be applied, of the amounts or any
part of the amounts remaining unpaid on their existing shares, and any agreement
made under such authority shall be effective and binding on all such members.

The Board may, in relation to any application sanctioned under Article 21.2 in its
absolute discretion specify that, and in such circumstances and if directed so to do by
a member or members entitled to an allotment and distribution credited as fully paid
up of unissued shares or debentures in the Company pursuant to such application, the
unissued shares, debentures or other securities to which that member is entitled shall
be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid up to such person or persons as that
member may nominate by notice in writing to the Company, such notice to be received
not later than the day for which the general meeting of the Company to sanction the
application is convened.

22.4

Subject to the provisions of the Act and these Articles, the Board may, by Resolution
of Directors, declare a dividend in any currency at a time, and of an amount, and to any
members it thinks fit if it is satisfied, on reasonable grounds that, immediately after the
payment of the dividend, the value of the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities
and the Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due.

The dividends, interest and bonuses and any other benefits and advantages in the nature
of income receivable in respect of the Company’s investments, and any commissions,
trusteeship, agency, transfer and other fees and current receipts of the Company shall,
subject to the payment thereout of the expenses of management, interest upon borrowed
money and other expenses which in the opinion of the Board are of a revenue nature,
constitute the profits of the Company available for distribution.

The Board may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear
to the Board to be justified by the profits of the Company and, in particular (but without
prejudice to the generality of the foregoing), if at any time the Company is authorised
to issue different classes of shares, the Board may pay such interim dividends in respect
of those shares in the Company which confer on the holders thereof deferred or non-
preferential rights as well as in respect of those shares which confer on the holders
thereof preferential rights with regard to dividend and provided that the Board acts bona
fide, the Board shall not incur any responsibility to the holders of shares conferring any
preferential rights.

The Board may also pay half-yearly or at other intervals to be selected by it any

dividend which may be payable at a fixed rate if the Board is of the opinion that the
profits available for distribution justify the payment.

22.5 The Board may in addition from time to time declare and pay special dividends
on shares of any class of such amounts and on such dates as they think fit, and the
provisions of Article 22.3 as regards the powers and the exemption from liability of the
Board as relate to declaration and payment of interim dividends shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the declaration and payment of any such special dividends.

22.6 No dividend shall carry interest against the Company.

22.7 Whenever the Board or the Company in general meeting has resolved that a dividend be
paid or declared on the shares in the Company, the Board may further resolve:

EITHER

(a)

that such dividend be satisfied wholly or in part in the form of an allotment of
shares credited as fully paid up, provided that the members entitled thereto will be
entitled to elect to receive such dividend (or part thereof) in cash in lieu of such
allotment. In such case, the following provisions shall apply:

(1)
(11)

(iii)

(iv)

the basis of any such allotment shall be determined by the Board;

the Board, after determining the basis of allotment, shall give not less than
two weeks’ notice in writing to the members of the right of election accorded
to them and shall send with such notice forms of election and specify the
procedure to be followed and the place at which and the latest date and time
by which duly completed forms of election must be lodged in order to be
effective;

the right of election may be exercised in respect of the whole or part of that
portion of the dividend in respect of which the right of election has been
accorded;

the dividend (or that part of the dividend to be satisfied by the allotment of
shares as aforesaid) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect whereof
the cash election has not been duly exercised (the “non-elected shares”)
and in satisfaction thereof shares shall be allotted credited as fully paid to
the holders of the non-elected shares on the basis of allotment determined
as aforesaid and for such purpose the Board shall apply out of any part of
the undivided profits of the Company or any part of any of the Company’s
reserve accounts (including any special account or share premium account
(if there be any such reserve)) or profit or loss account or amounts otherwise
available for distribution as the Board may determine, a sum equal to the
aggregate nominal amount of the shares to be allotted on such basis and
apply the same in paying up in full the appropriate number of shares for
allotment and distribution to and amongst the holders of the non-elected
shares on such basis;

33
OR

As to scrip (b) that members entitled to such dividend shall be entitled to elect to receive an

“ection allotment of shares credited as fully paid up in lieu of the whole or such part of
the dividend as the Board may think fit. In such case, the following provisions
shall apply:

(i) the basis of any such allotment shall be determined by the Board;

(ii) the Board, after determining the basis of allotment, shall give not less than
two weeks’ notice in writing to members of the right of election accorded
to them and shall send with such notice forms of election and specify the
procedure to be followed and the place at which and the latest date and time
by which duly completed forms of election must be lodged in order to be
effective;

(iui) the right of election may be exercised in respect of the whole or part of that
portion of the dividend in respect of which the right of election has been
accorded;

(iv) the dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of
election has been accorded) shall not be payable on shares in respect whereof
the share election has been duly exercised (the “elected shares”) and in lieu
thereof shares shall be allotted credited as fully paid to the holders of the
elected shares on the basis of allotment determined as aforesaid and for such
purpose the Board shall and apply out of any part of the undivided profits
of the Company’s reserve accounts (including any special account or share
premium account (if there be any such reserve)) or profit and loss account
or amounts otherwise available for distribution as the Board may determine,
a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the shares to be allotted on
such basis and apply the same in paying up in full the appropriate number
of shares for allotment and distribution to and amongst the holders of the
elected shares on such basis.

22.8 The shares allotted pursuant to the provisions of Article 22.7 shall be of the same class
as the class of, and shall rank pari passu in all respects with the shares then held by the
respective allottees save only as regards participation:

(a) inthe relevant dividend (or share or cash election in lieu thereof as aforesaid); or

(b) in any other distributions, bonuses or rights paid, made, declared or announced
prior to or contemporaneously with the payment or declaration of the relevant
dividend, unless contemporaneously with the announcement by the Board of its
proposal to apply the provisions of Article 22.7(a) or 22.7(b) in relation to the
relevant dividend or contemporaneously with its announcement of the distribution,
bonus or rights in question, the Board shall specify that the shares to be allotted
pursuant to the provisions of Article 22.7 shall rank for participation in such
distributions, bonuses or rights.

34
22.9 The Board may do all acts and things considered necessary or expedient to give effect to
any application pursuant to the provisions of Article 22.8 with full power to the Board
to make such provisions as it thinks fit in the case of shares becoming distributable in
fractions (including provisions whereby, in whole or in part, fractional entitlements are
aggregated and sold and the net proceeds distributed to those entitled, or are disregarded
or rounded up or down or whereby the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the
Company rather than to the members concerned). The Board may authorise any person
to enter into on behalf of all members interested, an agreement with the Company
providing for such application and matters incidental thereto and any agreement made
pursuant to such authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned.

22.10 The Company may upon the recommendation of the Board by Resolution of Members
resolve in respect of any one particular dividend of the Company that notwithstanding
the provisions of Article 22.7 a dividend may be satisfied wholly in the form of an
allotment of shares credited as fully paid without offering any right to members to elect
to receive such dividend in cash in lieu of such allotment.

22.11 The Board may on any occasion determine that rights of election and the allotment of
shares under Article 22.7 shall not be made available or made to any members with
registered addresses in any territory where in the absence of a registration statement
or other special formalities the circulation of an offer of such rights of election or the
allotment of shares would or might be unlawful, or where the Board considers the costs,
expenses or possible delays in ascertaining the existence or extent of the legal and other
requirements applicable to such offer or the acceptance of such offer out of proportion
to the benefit of the Company, and in any such case the provisions aforesaid shall be
read and construed subject to such determination.

22.12 The Board may, before recommending any dividend, set aside out of the profits of
the Company such sums as it thinks fit as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the
discretion of the Board, be applicable for meeting claims on or liabilities of the
Company or contingencies or for paying off any loan or for equalising dividends or
for any other purpose to which the profits of the Company may be properly applied,
and pending such application may, at the like discretion, either be employed in the
business of the Company or be invested in such investments (including shares, warrants
and other securities of the Company) as the Board may from time to time think fit,
and so that it shall not be necessary to keep any reserves separate or distinct from any
other investments of the Company. The Board may also without placing the same to
reserve carry forward any profits which it may think prudent not to distribute by way of

dividend.
fiends 22.13 Unless and to the extent that the rights attached to any shares or the terms of issue
sroportion to thereof otherwise provide, all dividends shall (as regards any shares not fully paid
amounts paid up throughout the period in respect of which the dividend is paid) be apportioned and paid

on shares

pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions
of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. For the purpose of this Article no
amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated as paid up on the share.

Retention of 22.14 The Board may retain any dividends or other moneys payable on or in respect of a share

Hiden upon which the Company has a lien, and may apply the same in or towards satisfaction
of the debts, liabilities or engagements in respect of which the lien exists.

22.15 The Board may retain any dividends or other monies payable upon shares in respect of
which any person is, under the provisions as to the transmission of shares hereinbefore
contained, entitled to become a member, or in respect of which any person is under
those provisions entitled to transfer, until such person shall become a member in respect
of such shares or shall transfer the same.

22.16 The Board may deduct from any dividend or other monies payable to any member all
sums of money (if any) presently payable by him to the Company on account of calls,
instalments or otherwise.

22.17 Any general meeting sanctioning a dividend may make a call on the members of such
amount as the meeting resolves by Resolution of Members, but so that the call on each
member shall not exceed the dividend payable to him, and so that the call be made
payable at the same time as the dividend, and the dividend may, if so arranged between
the Company and the member, be set off against the call.

22.18 The Board, with the sanction by Resolution of Members, may direct that any dividend
be satisfied wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets of any kind and in
particular of paid up shares, debentures or warrants to subscribe securities of any other
company, or in any one or more of such ways, and where any difficulty arises in regard
to the distribution the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient, and in particular
may disregard fractional entitlements, round the same up or down or provide that the
same shall accrue to the benefit of the Company, and may fix the value for distribution
of such specific assets, or any part thereof, and may determine that cash payments
shall be made to any members upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust
the rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem
expedient to the Board and may appoint any person to sign any requisite instruments of
transfer and other documents on behalf of the persons entitled to the dividend and such
appointment shall be effective. Where required, a contract shall be filed in accordance
with the provisions of the Act and the Board may appoint any person to sign such
contract on behalf of the persons entitled to the dividend and such appointment shall be
effective.

22.19 A transfer of shares shall not pass therewith the right to any dividend or bonus declared
thereon before the registration of the transfer.

22.20 Any resolution declaring or resolving upon the payment of a dividend or other
distribution on shares of any class, whether a Resolution of Members or a Resolution
of Directors, may specify that the same shall be payable or made to the persons
registered as the holders of such shares at the close of business on a particular date,
notwithstanding that it may be a date prior to that on which the resolution is passed,
and thereupon the dividend or other distribution shall be payable or made to them in
accordance with their respective holdings so registered, but without prejudice to the
rights inter se in respect of such dividend of transferors and transferees of any such
shares.

22.21 If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any shares, any one of such
persons may give effectual receipts for any dividends, interim and special dividends or
bonuses and other moneys payable or rights or property distributable in respect of such
shares.

22.22 Unless otherwise directed by the Board, any dividend, interest or other sum payable
in cash to a holder of shares may be paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post
to the registered address of the member entitled, or, in case of joint holders, to the
registered address of the person whose name stands first in the register in respect of the
joint holding or to such person and to such address as the holder or joint holders may in
writing direct. Every cheque or warrant so sent shall be made payable to the order of the
holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first
on the register in respect of such shares and shall be sent at his or their risk, and the
payment of any such cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn shall operate
as a good discharge to the Company in respect of the dividend and/or bonus represented
thereby, notwithstanding that it may subsequently appear that the same has been stolen
or that any endorsement thereon has been forged.

22.23 The Company may cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend
warrants by post if such cheques or warrants have been left uncashed on two consecutive
occasions. However, the Company may exercise its power to cease sending cheques
for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants after the first occasion on which such a
cheque or warrant is returned undelivered.

22.24 All dividends or bonuses unclaimed for one year after having been declared may
be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the exclusive benefit of the
Company until claimed and the Company shall not be constituted a trustee in respect
thereof or be required to account for any money earned thereon. All dividends or
bonuses unclaimed for six years after having been declared may be forfeited by the
Board and shall revert to the Company and after such forfeiture no member or other
person shall have any right to or claim in respect of such dividends or bonuses.

22.25 In relation to any other distribution, the Company may, by Special Resolution of
Members, authorise a distribution by the Company to the members (other than by way
of the purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares in the Company or by way
of dividend) at such time and of such an amount, provided the Board is satisfied, on
reasonable grounds that, immediately after the payment of the distribution, the value of
the Company’s assets will exceed its liabilities and the Company is able to pay its debts
as they fall due.

Untraceable Members

23.1 The Company shall be entitled to sell any shares of a member or the shares to which a
person is entitled by virtue of transmission on death or bankruptcy or operation of law
if and provided that:

in cash to the holder of such shares have remained uncashed for a period of 12
years;

(b) the Company has not during that time or before the expiry of the three month
period referred to in Article 23.1(d) below received any indication of the

shares, and a period of three months has elapsed since such advertisement and the
Exchange has been notified of such intention.

The net proceeds of any such sale shall belong to the Company and upon receipt by the
Company of such net proceeds it shall become indebted to the former member for an
amount equal to such net proceeds.

person to execute as transferor an instrument of transfer of the said shares and such
other documents as are necessary to effect the transfer, and such documents shall be
as effective as if it had been executed by the registered holder of or person entitled by
transmission to such shares and the title of the transferee shall not be affected by any
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating thereto. The net proceeds of sale
shall belong to the Company which shall be obliged to account to the former member
or other person previously entitled as aforesaid for an amount equal to such proceeds
and shall enter the name of such former member or other person in the books of the
Company as a creditor for such amount. No trust shall be created in respect of the
debt, no interest shall be payable in respect of the same and the Company shall not be
required to account for any money earned on the net proceeds, which may be employed
in the business of the Company or invested in such investments (other than shares or
other securities in or of the Company or its holding company if any) or as the Board
may from time to time think fit.

24 hours and such notice shall be deemed to have been received by such member on

be construed as prohibiting the Company from sending, or entitling the Company not
to send, notices or other documents of the Company to any member whose registered
address is outside Hong Kong.

following that on which it is put into a post office situated within Hong Kong and

containing the notice or document was properly prepaid, addressed and put into such
post office and a certificate in writing signed by the Secretary or other person appointed
by the Board that the envelope or wrapper containing the notice or document was so
addressed and put into such post office shall be conclusive evidence thereof.

Any notice or other document delivered or left at a registered address otherwise than by
post shall be deemed to have been served or delivered on the day it was so delivered or
left.

Any notice served by advertisement shall be deemed to have been served on the day
of issue of the official publication and/or newspaper(s) in which the advertisement
is published (or on the last day of issue if the publication and/or newspaper(s) are
published on different dates).

Any notice given by electronic means as provided herein shall be deemed to have been
served and delivered on the day following that on which it is successfully transmitted or
at such later time as may be prescribed by the Listing Rules or any applicable laws or
regulations.

consequence of the death, mental disorder or bankruptcy of a member by sending it
through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to him or them by name, or by the title of
representative of the deceased, or trustee of the bankrupt, or by any like description, at
the address, if any, within Hong Kong supplied for the purpose by the person claiming
to be so entitled, or (until such an address has been so supplied) by giving the notice in
any manner in which the same might have been given if the death, mental disorder or
bankruptcy had not occurred.

28.10 Any person who by operation of law, transfer or other means whatsoever shall become

some other person be registered in his stead as the holder or joint holder thereof, and

such notice or document on his personal representatives and all persons (if any) jointly

No member shall be entitled to require discovery of or any information in respect of
any detail of the Company’s trading or any matter which is or may be in the nature of
a trade secret or secret process which may relate to the conduct of the business of the
Company and which in the opinion of the Board would not be in the interests of the
members or the Company to communicate to the public.

The Board shall be entitled to release or disclose any information in its possession,
custody or control regarding the Company or its affairs to any of its members including,
without limitation, information contained in the register of members and transfer books
of the Company.

Winding Up

30.1

30.2

If the Company shall be wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under
supervision or by the court) the liquidator may, with the authority of a Special
Resolution of Members of the Company and any other sanction required by the Act
divide among the members in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of the
Company (whether the assets shall consist of property of one kind or shall consist of
properties of different kinds) and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair
upon any property to be divided and may determine how such division shall be carried
out as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator may, with
the like authority or sanction vest the whole or any part of such assets in trustees upon
such trusts for the benefit of the members as the liquidator, with the like authority or
sanction and subject to the Act, shall think fit, and the liquidation of the Company may
be closed and the Company dissolved, but so that no member shall be compelled to
accept any assets, shares or other securities in respect of which there is a liability.

If the Company shall be wound up, and the assets available for distribution amongst the
members as such shall be insufficient to repay the whole of the amounts paid up on the
issued shares in the Company, such assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may
be, the losses shall be borne by the members in proportion to the nominal value of such
shares, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up
on the shares held by them respectively. And if in a winding up the assets available for
distribution amongst the members shall be more than sufficient to repay the whole of
the amounts paid up on the issued shares in the Company at the commencement of the
winding up, the excess shall be distributed amongst the members in proportion to the
nominal value of such shares at the commencement of the winding up on the shares held
by them respectively. This Article is to be without prejudice to the rights of the holders
of shares issued upon special terms and conditions.

Company who is not for the time being in Hong Kong shall be bound, within 14 days
after the passing of an effective resolution to wind up the Company voluntarily, or the
making of an order for the winding-up of the Company, to serve notice in writing on the
Company appointing some person resident in Hong Kong and stating that person’s full
name, address and occupation upon whom all summonses, notices, process, orders and
judgments in relation to or under the winding-up of the Company may be served, and in
default of such nomination the liquidator of the Company shall be at liberty on behalf
of such member to appoint some such person, and service upon any such appointee,
whether appointed by the member or the liquidator, shall be deemed to be good personal
service on such member for all purposes, and, where the liquidator makes any such
appointment, he shall with all convenient speed give notice thereof to such member
by advertisement as he shall deem appropriate or by a registered letter sent through
the post and addressed to such member at his address as appearing in the register,
and such notice shall be deemed to be service on the day following that on which the
advertisement first appears or the letter is posted.

Indemnities

31.1 Every Director, Auditor or other officer of the Company shall be entitled to be
indemnified out of the assets of the Company against all losses or habilities incurred or
sustained by him as a Director, Auditor or other officer of the Company in defending
any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is given in his favour, or
in which he is acquitted.

31.2 Subject to the Act, if any Director or other person shall become personally liable for the
payment of any sum primarily due from the Company, the Board may execute or cause
to be executed any mortgage, charge, or security over or affecting the whole or any part
of the assets of the Company by way of indemnity to secure the Director or person so
becoming liable as aforesaid from any loss in respect of such liability.

Financial Year

The financial year of the Company shall be prescribed by the Board and may, from time to
time, be changed by it.

Amendment of Memorandum and Articles

Subject to the Act, the Company may at any time and from time to time by Special Resolution
of Members alter or amend its Memorandum and these Articles in whole or in part, except the
Company may amend the Memorandum and these Articles to increase the maximum number
of shares the Company is authorised to issue by Resolution of Members.

Transfer by Way of Continuation

The Company may, by a Resolution of Members, continue as a company incorporated under
