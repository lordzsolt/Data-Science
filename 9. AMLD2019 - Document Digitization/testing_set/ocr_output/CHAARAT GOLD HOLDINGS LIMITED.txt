Each register of members may be in any such form as the Directors may approve, but if it is in
magnetic, electronic or other data storage form, the Company must be able to produce legible
evidence of its contents. Until the Directors otherwise determine, the magnetic, electronic or
other data storage form shall be the original of each register of members.

issued may be issued, held, registered, converted to, transferred or otherwise dealt with in
uncertificated form in accordance with the Regulations and practices instituted by the operator
of the relevant systems and no provision of these Articles will apply to any uncertificated
Share or other securities of the Company to the extent that they are inconsistent with the
holding of such Shares or other securities in-uncertificated form or the transfer of title to any
such Shares or other securities by means of a relevant system or any provision of Regulations.

Conversion of Shares held in certificated form into Shares held in uncertificated form, and vice

other person, for his or his estate's debts liabilities and engagements, whether solely or jointly

respect of which the lien exists is presently payable.

The Directors shall, subject always to the Act and the Regulations, and the facilities and
requirements of any relevant system concerned and these Articles, have power to implement
and/or approve any arrangements they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit (to the extent
implemented and/or approved with effect on or after the date of adoption of these Articles) in
relation to the evidencing of title to and transfer of interests in Shares in the form of
Depositary Interests, and to the extent such arrangements are so implemented, no provision of
these Articles shall apply or have effect to the extent that it is in any respect inconsistent with
the holding or transfer thereof or the Share represented thereby. The Directors may from time
to time take such actions and do such things as they may, in their absolute discretion, think fit
(to the extent implemented and/or approved with effect on or after the date of adoption of
these Articles) in relation to the operation of any such arrangements.

Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or as required by law, but without prejudice
to the provisions of these Articles relating to the Depositary or Depositary Interests, no person shall
be recognised by the Company as holding any Share upon trust and the Company shall not be
bound by or required in any way, to recognise (even. when having notice thereof) any equitable,
contingent, future or partial interest.in any Share.or any interest in any fractional part of a Share or
(except only as otherwise provided in these. Articles) any other right in respect of any Share except
an absolute right to the entirety thereof in the registered holder.

indirectly, Shares having more than 50 per cent of the votes in the election of directors of the
other body corporate, all rights and.obligations attaching to the Shares held by the other body

of doubt where the offeror (together with its Associates) already holds Shares carrying more
than 50% of the voting rights at the time when the offer is made, the offer may not be subject
to any conditions.

No acquisition of Shares which would give rise to a requirement for any offer under this
Regulation may be made or (unless it is an excepted transfer falling within Regulation

offer must be made, any offer required to be made pursuant to this Regulation 19 shall be
made on terms that would be required by the City Code, save to the extent that the Board

person appointed by the Board to make such determination, in each case with absolute
discretion.

Shares of the Company and in relation to their dealings with the Company in relation to all

be determined by the Board or by such person appointed by the Board to make such

place on the same date on which Shares are sold under the offer (or, if later, within 7 days of

as appropriate).

name of the original Member shall be deemed» to be cancelled and (if required by the
purchaser) a new certificate shall be issued in the name of purchaser or its nominee. The
receipt of the Company for the consideration shall be a good discharge to purchaser who shall
not be bound to see to the application of it, and after such registration in exercise of the above
powers the validity of the proceedings shall not be questioned by any person. The Company
shall hold the said consideration on behalf of any such Member in a separate bank account on

The Company may, upon the recommendation of the Board by Special Resolution resolve to
capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any of the Company's reserve accounts (including
any share premium account and any capital redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to
the credit of profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution, provided that such
sum be not required for paying the dividends on any Shares carrying a fixed cumulative
preferential dividend, and accordingly that the Board be authorised and directed to appropriate
the sum resolved to be capitalised to the Members in the proportions in which such sum would
have been divisible amongst them had the same been applied or been applicable in paying
dividends and to apply such sum on their behalf, either in or towards paying up the amounts, if
any, for the time being unpaid on any Shares held by such Members respectively or in paying
up in full unissued Shares or debentures of the Company of a nominal amount equal to such
sum such Shares or debentures to be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid up to and
amongst such Members in the proportions aforesaid or partly in one way and partly in the
other, provided that a sum standing to the credit of a share premium account or a capital
redemption reserve fund may only be applied hereunder in the paying up of unissued Shares to
be allotted to Members as fully paid.

The Company in general meeting by Special Resolution may on the recommendation of the
Board resolve that it is desirable to.capitalise any part of the amount for the time being
standing to the credit of any of the Company's reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit
and loss account which is not available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up in
full unissued Shares to be-allotted as fully paid Shares to those members of the Company for
the time being who would have been entitled to that sum if it were distributed by way of
dividend (and in the same proportions) and the Board shall-give effect to such resolution.

Whenever such a resolution as aforesaid is passed, the Board shall make all appropriations and
applications of the sum resolved to be capitalised thereby and all allotments and issues Shares
or debentures, if any, and generally shall do all acts and things required to give effect thereto
with full power to the Board to. make such provision by the issue of certificates in respect of
fractional entitlements or by payment m-cash-or otherwise as it thinks fit for the case of Shares
or debentures becoming distributable in fractions, and also to authorise any person to enter on
behalf of all the Members interested into any agreement with the Company providing for the
allotment to them respectively credited as fully paid up of any further Shares to which they
may be entitled upon such capitalisation and any agreement made under such authority shall be
effective and binding on all such Members.
