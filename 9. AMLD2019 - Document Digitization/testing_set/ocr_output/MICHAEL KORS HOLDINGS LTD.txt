(a)
(b)

10,856,853 preference shares of no par value each (the “ Preference Shares ”); and

10.

11.

Ranking. The Preference Shares shall, with respect to dividend rights, rights on other distributions and rights upon liquidation, winding up or
dissolution, rank (a) senior to the Ordinary Shares and any other class or series of ordinary, preference or other shares or Equity Securities of the
Company now or hereafter authorized (such Equity Securities, “‘ Junior Securities ”?) and (b) junior to any indebtedness now or hereafter incurred by
the Company.

Dividends .

(a)

(b)

Subject to clause 11(c) below, if the Company declares and pays any dividends on the Ordinary Shares, then, in that event, holders of
Preference Shares shall be entitled to share in such dividends on a pro rata basis, as if their Preference Shares had been converted into Ordinary
Shares pursuant to clause 13 below immediately prior to the record date for determining the holders of Ordinary Shares eligible to receive such
dividends.

If the Company does not consummate a Qualified IPO within 18 months after the Closing (“‘ IPO Dividend Date’), the Board of Directors shall
(subject to the Company’s compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Articles) declare and the holders of Preference Shares shall
receive, in addition to the dividends described in clause 11 (a), dividends at an annual rate equal to 10% of the Accreted Value, calculated on
the basis of a 360-day year, consisting of twelve 30-day months, which shall accrue on a daily basis from the IPO Dividend Date, whether or
not declared by the Board of Directors, and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each
year (unless any such day is not a Business Day, in which event such dividends shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day, without
accrual to the actual payment date) (each such date, a “ Dividend Payment Date ”’). Unless otherwise specified in a resolution of directors,
accrued and unpaid dividends shall compound and be added to the Accreted Value in effect immediately prior to each Dividend Payment Date;
provided , that, in lieu
(c)

thereof, such accrued and unpaid dividends may (i) be paid to the holders of Preference Shares in cash or (ii) be paid in cash or compound and
be added to the Accreted Value in any combination thereof, in each case as specified in a resolution of directors.

The Company shall not declare or pay any dividends on, or make any other distributions with respect to or redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire for consideration, any Junior Securities unless and until (i) all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid in
full and (ii) prior to the IPO Dividend Date, the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding
Preference Shares, voting as a separate class, shall have been received; provided , however , that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any:

(i) redemption, purchase or other acquisition of Junior Securities in connection with any put or call post-termination rights in any
employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries;

(ii) exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Securities for any class or series of Junior

(iii) purchase of fractional interests in any Junior Securities under the conversion or exchange provisions of such Junior Securities or the

12. Liquidation Event and Company Sale .

(a)

Liquidation . Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company (each, a “ Liquidation Event’), after
satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations to creditors of the Company and before any distribution or payment shall be made to holders of any
Junior Securities, each holder of Preference Shares shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof (whether
capital or surplus) legally available therefor, an amount per Preference Share in cash equal to the greater of (i) the sum of (x) the Accreted
Value, plus (y) any unpaid dividends on such Preference Share that have accrued since the last Dividend Payment Date through the date of such
Liquidation Event or (ii) the aggregate amount payable in such Liquidation Event with respect to the number of Ordinary Shares into which
such Preference Share is convertible immediately prior to such Liquidation Event (assuming the conversion of all such Preference Shares in
accordance with clause 13) (the greater of subclause (i) or subclause (ii), the “ Liquidation Preference ”’). Holders of Preference Shares shall not
be entitled to any
(b)

(c)

other amounts from the Company after they have received the full amounts provided for in this clause 12(a) and will have no right or claim to
any of the Company’s remaining assets. If the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay in full the Liquidation
Preference payable on the Preference Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the full
respective amounts which would be payable on the Preference Shares if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.

Company Sale . No Company Sale shall be consummated unless, prior to any distribution or payment being made to holders of any Junior
Securities, each holder of Preference Shares shall be entitled to receive an amount per Preference Share equal to the greater of (i) the sum of
(x) the Accreted Value of such Preference Share plus (y) any unpaid dividends on such Preference Share that have accrued since the last
Dividend Payment Date through the date of such Company Sale or (ii) the aggregate amount of consideration payable in such Company Sale
with respect to the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Preference Share is convertible immediately prior to such Company Sale
(assuming the conversion of all such Preference Shares in accordance with clause 13) (the greater of subclause (i) or subclause (ii), the “ Sale
Payment”). The Sale Payment shall be paid in the same form of consideration and proportion (i.e., in cash and/or other consideration) paid in
such Company Sale on the closing date of such Company Sale; provided , however , if such Company Sale is entered into prior to the three
year anniversary of the Closing, then the consideration payable to each holder of Preference Shares shall be payable either (1) solely in cash or
Liquid Securities, or (ii) solely to the extent holders of Ordinary Shares are receiving securities, other than Liquid Securities in such Company
Sale, then each holder of Preference Shares shall have the option of receiving non-Liquid Securities of either the same class received by holders
of Ordinary Shares or in the form of Acceptable Securities. The value of any non-cash consideration to be delivered to the holders of
Preference Shares in a Company Sale shall be the fair market value of such non-cash consideration (as determined by an independent appraiser
selected in good faith by the Board of Directors). Upon receipt of the full amounts provided for in this clause 12(b), the Preference Shares shall
be automatically cancelled and the holders of Preference Shares shall not be entitled to any other amounts. If the assets of the Company or
proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay in full the aggregate Sale Payment payable on the Preference Shares, then such assets, or the proceeds
thereof, shall be paid pro rata in accordance with the full respective amounts which would be payable on the Preference Shares if all amounts
payable thereon were paid in full.

Notice . Written notice of a Liquidation Event or a Company Sale stating a payment or payments and the place where such payment or
payments shall
be payable shall be mailed not less than ten (10) days prior to the earliest payment date stated therein to each holder of Preference Shares at
such holder’s address as it appears on the transfer books of the Company.

13. Conversion.

(a)

Optional Conversion . Each holder of Preference Shares shall have the right, at its option, at any time and from time to time, to convert, subject
to the terms and provisions of this clause 13, any or all of such holder’s Preference Shares into such number of fully paid and non-assessable
Ordinary Shares as is equal to the product of (i) the number of Preference Shares being so converted, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (x) the
Accreted Value, divided by (y) the Preference Share Issue Amount, subject to adjustment as provided in clause 13(f) below (such price in
subclause (y), the “ Conversion Price ” and such quotient in subclause (ii), the ““ Conversion Ratio”). At the option of the Company, any
accrued and unpaid dividends as of the date of conversion in respect of the Preference Shares being converted shall (i) be added to the Accreted
Value, (ii) be paid in cash to the holder of such Preference Shares or (iii) be paid in cash or added to the Accreted Value in any combination
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of calculating the Conversion Ratio, the Accreted Value of the Preference Shares that are
being converted shall include the amount of any dividends which have been accreted, compounded and added to the Preference Share Issue
Amount pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of “Accreted Value” through the last Dividend Payment Date. Such conversion right shall be
exercised by the surrender of certificate(s) evidencing the Preference Shares to be converted to the Company at any time during usual business
hours at its principal place of business (or such other office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to
the holders of Preference Shares), accompanied by written notice that the holder elects to convert such Preference Shares and specifying the
name or names (with address) in which a certificate or certificates for Ordinary Shares are to be issued and (if so required by the Company) by
a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company duly executed by the holder or its duly
authorized legal representative and transfer tax stamps or funds therefor, if required pursuant to clause 13(1) below. All certificates evidencing
Preference Shares surrendered for conversion shall be delivered to the Company for cancellation and cancelled by it. As promptly as
practicable after the surrender of any Preference Shares, the Company shall (subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of federal and
state securities Laws) deliver to the holder of such Preference Shares so surrendered, certificate(s) evidencing the number of fully paid and non-
assessable Ordinary Shares into which such Preference Shares are entitled to be converted. Upon registration in the register of members of the
Company (which shall be subject to surrender of such share
(b)

certificates) to reflect the conversion, the person in whose name any certificate(s) for Ordinary Shares shall be issuable upon such conversion
shall be the holder of record of such Ordinary Shares on such date, notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing such Ordinary Shares shall
not then be actually delivered to such person.

Automatic Conversion .

(i)

(ii)

Upon the earlier of (x) immediately prior to the consummation of a Qualified IPO and (y) the receipt of the approval of the holders of
66 2/3% of the then outstanding Preference Shares (each an (“Automatic Conversion Date’’), all of the Preference Shares shall be
automatically converted into the number of fully paid and non-assessable Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (1) the number of
Preference Shares being converted, multiplied by (2) the Conversion Ratio calculated as of the date of such automatic conversion and
the register of members of the Company shall be updated to reflect the conversion. At the option of the Company, any accrued and
unpaid dividends as of the Automatic Conversion Date in respect to the Preference Shares being converted shall (i) be added to the
Accreted Value, (ii) be paid in cash to the holder of such Preference Shares or (iii) be paid in cash or added to the Accreted Value in
any combination thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of calculating the Conversion Ratio in connection with any
automatic conversion, the Accreted Value of the Preference Shares that are being converted shall include the amount of any dividends
which have been accreted, compounded and added to the Preference Share Issue Amount pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of
“Accreted Value” through the last Dividend Payment Date.

Immediately upon conversion as provided in clause 13(b)(i), each holder of Preference Shares shall be registered in the Company’s
register of members as the holder of record of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of such holder’s Preference Shares,
notwithstanding that certificates evidencing the Ordinary Shares shall not then actually be delivered to such person. Upon written notice
and instructions from the Company, each holder of Preference Shares so converted shall promptly surrender to the Company at its
principal place of business (or at such other office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by such notice to the
holders of Preference Shares) certificates representing the Preference Shares so converted. As promptly as practicable after such
conversion, the Company shall deliver to the holder of such Preference Shares so surrendered, certificate(s) evidencing

9
(c)

(d)

(e)

the number of fully paid and non-assessable Ordinary Shares into which such Preference Shares are entitled to be converted.

Conversion mechanics .

(1) All conversions of Preference Shares to Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause 13 shall be effected by the Company by way of
repurchase by the Company of the Preference Shares in consideration for the simultaneous issue of Ordinary Shares, credited as fully
paid.

(11) Any conversion of Preference Shares to Ordinary Shares pursuant to this clause 13 shall be deemed to be effected (a) in the event of a

voluntary conversion pursuant to clause 13(a), at the time that the registrar of the Company registers the conversion in the Company’s
register of members following written notice of the conversion having been provided to the registrar of the Company and (b) in the
event of an automatic conversion of all of Preference pursuant to clause 13(b), at the time that the registrar of the Company registers the
conversion in the Company’s register of members which time shall be the Automatic Conversion Date.

Termination of Rights . On the date of an optional conversion pursuant to clause 13(a) or of an automatic conversion pursuant to clause 13(b)
(i), all rights with respect to the Preference Shares so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote, shall terminate, except
only the rights of holders thereof to (i) receive certificates for the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Preference Shares have been
converted, and (ii) exercise the rights to which they are entitled as holders of Ordinary Shares. No holder of Preference Shares whose
Preference Shares have been converted pursuant to clause 13(a) or clause 13(b)(i) shall be entitled to any further accrual of dividends in respect
of such converted Preference Shares.

No Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or securities representing fractional Ordinary Shares shall be issued upon conversion of the
Preference Shares. Any fractional interest in Ordinary Shares resulting from conversion of the Preference Shares shall be paid in cash
(computed to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value per Ordinary Share as determined by the Board of
Directors in good faith. If more than one certificate evidencing Preference Shares is surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder,
the number of full Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of the Preference
Shares so surrendered for conversion.

10
(f) Antidilution Adjustments . The Conversion Price and the Conversion Ratio shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(i)

(il)

Division or Combination of Ordinary Shares . In the event that the Company shall at any time or from time to time, prior to conversion
of Preference Shares effect a division or combination of shares in respect of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, then, and in each such
case, the Conversion Price and/or the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted (and any other
appropriate actions shall be taken by the Company) so that the holder of any Preference Share thereafter surrendered for conversion
shall be entitled to receive the number of Ordinary Shares that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to receive
upon or by reason of any of the events described above, had such Preference Share been converted immediately prior to the occurrence
of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this clause 13(f)(i) shall become effective retroactively to the close of business on the
day upon which such corporate action becomes effective. No adjustments shall be made under this Section 13(f) in respect of any
dividends (or any other distribution) paid in accordance with clause 11.

 

Certain Dilutive Issuances of Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share Equivalents .

 

(w) Ifthe Company shall at any time or from time to time prior to conversion of Preference Shares, issue or sell any Ordinary Shares
or any security or obligation which is by its terms, directly or indirectly, convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into or for
Ordinary Shares and any option, warrant or other subscription or purchase right with respect to Ordinary Shares or such security
or obligation (“‘ Ordinary Share Equivalents ”’) at a price per Ordinary Share (the “‘ New Issue Price ”’) that is less than the
Conversion Price as of the record date or Issue Date (as defined below), as the case may be (the “ Relevant Date ”’) (treating the
New Issue Price, in the case of the issuance of any Ordinary Share Equivalent, as equal to (A) the sum of the price for such
Ordinary Share Equivalent plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the
conversion, exchange or exercise of such Ordinary Share Equivalent, divided by (B) the number of Ordinary Shares initially
underlying such Ordinary Share Equivalent) (other than (1) issuances or sales of Ordinary Shares for which an adjustment is
made in connection with a division or combination or

 

11
(x)

reclassification of Ordinary Shares pursuant to clause 13(f)(i) and (2) issuances in connection with an Excluded Transaction),
then , and in each such case, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect
on the day immediately prior to the Relevant Date by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of (1) the number of
outstanding Ordinary Shares (assuming the conversion, exchange and exercise of all Ordinary Share Equivalents) on the Relevant
Date, plus (2) the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Company for the total number of
such additional Ordinary Shares so issued would purchase at the Conversion Price on the Relevant Date (or, in the case of
Ordinary Share Equivalents, the number of Ordinary Shares which the aggregate consideration received by the Company upon
the issuance of such Ordinary Share Equivalents and receivable by the Company upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of
such Ordinary Share Equivalents would purchase at the Conversion Price on the Relevant Date) and (ii) the denominator of

which shall be the sum of the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares (assuming the conversion, exchange and exercise of all
Ordinary Share Equivalents) on the Relevant Date, plus the number of additional Ordinary Shares issued or to be issued (or, in
the case of Ordinary Share Equivalents, the maximum number of Ordinary Shares into which such Ordinary Share Equivalents
initially may convert, exchange or be exercised).

Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share Equivalents are issued, and shall become
effective retroactively (A) in the case of an issuance to the members, as such, to a date immediately following the close of
business on the record date for the determination of members entitled to receive such Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share
Equivalents and (B) in all other cases, on the date of such issuance (the “Issue Date’’); provided , however , that the determination
as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to this clause 13(f)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such
Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share Equivalents, and not upon the issuance of any security into which the Ordinary Share
Equivalents convert, exchange or may be exercised.

12
(iii)

(y)

(z)

In case at any time any Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share Equivalents shall be issued or sold for cash, the consideration received
therefor shall be deemed to be the amount received by the Company therefor, without deduction therefrom of any expenses
incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the Company in connection therewith.
In case any Ordinary Shares or Ordinary Share Equivalents shall be issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount
of the consideration other than cash received by the Company shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such consideration,
without deduction therefrom of any expenses incurred or any placement agent fees, any underwriting commissions or
concessions or discounts paid or allowed by the Company in connection therewith, as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors.

If any Ordinary Share Equivalents (or any portions thereof) which shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause
13(f)Gi) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or if by reason of the terms of such Ordinary Share
Equivalents there shall have been an increase or increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Price hereunder shall be readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally
adjusted) in order to (A) eliminate from the computation any additional Ordinary Shares corresponding to such Ordinary Share
Equivalents as shall have expired or terminated, (B) treat the additional Ordinary Shares, if any, actually issued or issuable
pursuant to the previous exercise of such Ordinary Share Equivalents as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (C) treat any of such Ordinary Share Equivalents which remain outstanding as being subject
to exercise or conversion on the basis of such exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time.

Other Changes . In case the Company at any time or from time to time, prior to the conversion of Preference Shares, shall take any
action affecting the Ordinary Shares similar to or having an effect similar to any of the actions described in any of clauses 13(f)(i) or

(ii) above or clause 13(i) below (but not including any action described in any such clause) and the Board of Directors in good faith

determines that it would be equitable in the circumstances to adjust the Conversion Price or the Conversion Ratio as a result of

13
(g)

(h)

(i)

such action, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price or the Conversion Ratio (as applicable) shall be adjusted in such manner
and at such time as the Board of Directors in good faith determines would be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be
evidenced in a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the holders of Preference Shares).

(iv) |No Adjustment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment under this clause 13(f) need be made to the
Conversion Price or the Conversion Ratio if the Company receives written notice from holders of a majority of the then outstanding
Preference Shares that no such adjustment is required.

Abandonment . If the Company shall take a record of the holders of Ordinary Shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or
other distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to such holders legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then no adjustment in the Conversion Price or the Conversion Ratio shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

Certificate as to Adjustments . Upon any adjustment in the Conversion Price or the Conversion Ratio, the Company shall within a reasonable
period (not to exceed twenty (20) Business Days) following any of the foregoing transactions deliver to each holder of Preference Shares a
certificate, signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the adjustment and the
method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Conversion Price or Conversion Ratio then in
effect following such adjustment.

 

Reorganization; Reclassification . In case of any merger or consolidation of the Company (other than a Company Sale) or any capital
reorganization, reclassification or other change of outstanding Ordinary Shares (other than (i) a change in par value, or from par value to no par
value, or from no par value to par value or (ii) a transaction for which an adjustment is made in connection with clause 13(f)(i) or clause 13(f)
(ii)) in each case as a result of which the Ordinary Shares would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities, other property or
assets (each, a “ Transaction ’’), then, at the effective time of the Transaction, the right to convert each Preference Share shall be changed into a
right to convert such Preference Share into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets that a holder of
Preference Shares would have received in respect of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of such Preference Shares immediately prior
to such Transaction. In the event that holders of Ordinary Shares have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in the

 

14
G)

(k)

()

Transaction, the Company shall make adequate provision whereby the holders of Preference Shares shall have a reasonable opportunity to
determine the form of consideration into which all of the Preference Shares, treated as a single class, shall be convertible from and after the
effective date of the Transaction.

Notices . In the event (i) that the Company authorizes the granting to the holders of Ordinary Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any shares of Equity Securities of any class or of any other rights or warrants, (ii) of any Transaction, or (iii) of a Qualified IPO or a
Company Sale, then the Company shall mail to each holder of Preference Shares at such holder’s address as it appears on the transfer books of
the Company, as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice
stating (A) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or granting of rights or warrants or, if a
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Ordinary Shares of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or granting
of rights or warrants are to be determined, or (B) the date on which such Transaction, Qualified IPO or Company Sale is expected to become
effective and, if applicable, the date as of which it is expected that holders of Ordinary Shares of record shall be entitled to exchange their
Ordinary Shares for shares of stock or other securities or property or cash deliverable upon such Transaction, Qualified IPO or Company Sale.

Reservation of Ordinary Shares . The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available for issuance upon the conversion of Preference
Shares, such number of its authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares as will from time to time be sufficient to permit the conversion of all
outstanding Preference Shares, and shall take all action to increase the authorized number of Ordinary Shares if at any time there shall be
insufficient authorized but unissued Ordinary Shares to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all outstanding Preference
Shares; provided , that the holders of Preference Shares vote such Preference Shares in favor of any such action that requires a vote of
members.

No Conversion Tax or Charge . The issuance or delivery of certificates for Ordinary Shares upon the conversion of Preference Shares shall be
made without charge to the converting holder of Preference Shares for such certificates or for any tax in respect of the issuance or delivery of

SCHEDULE
Article I

Preemptive Rights

Preemptive Rights

(a)

(b)

(c)

If the Company or any of its subsidiaries proposes to issue, offer, sell or otherwise Transfer to any person (i) Equity Securities in the Company
or such subsidiary, or (ii) any rights to subscribe for or purchase pursuant to any option or otherwise any Equity Securities of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, in each case except as provided in Section 2 (each, a “‘ New Issuance’), or enter into any contracts relating to a New
Issuance, the Company shall provide written notice to each member of such proposed New Issuance at least fifteen (15) Business Days in
advance of the anticipated issuance date (the “‘ New Issuance Notice”), which shall set forth the identity of the proposed purchaser, the number
of Equity Securities proposed to be offered (the “ Offered Securities ”), the cash purchase price per security (the “ Offering Price ”’), the
anticipated issuance date and the other material terms and conditions of such New Issuance. Each member shall have the right to purchase for
cash up to its Pro Rata Share of the Offered Securities (which, in the case of a New Issuance by a subsidiary of the Company shall be
determined on a look-through basis, based on its indirect percentage of the outstanding common shares of such subsidiary), at the price per
security and otherwise on the same terms and conditions as such New Issuance.

A member may elect to exercise its preemptive rights with respect to such New Issuance by delivering an irrevocable written notice (a “
Section 1 Notice ”’) to the Company within ten (10) Business Days after the date the New Issuance Notice is delivered, setting forth the
maximum percentage of the Offered Securities that such member desires to hold following the consummation of the New Issuance. If a
member does not deliver a Section | Notice in accordance with this Section 1, then such member shall be deemed to have elected not to
exercise its preemptive rights with respect to such New Issuance. For purposes of this Article I, an exercising member may allocate its portion
of the Offered Securities among one or more of its Affiliates at the discretion of such exercising member.

At least three (3) Business Days prior to the consummation of any New Issuance, the Company shall provide written notice to each electing
member, which shall set forth the actual issuance date (determined in accordance with the following sentence) and such electing member’s Pro
Rata Share or such lesser percentage set forth in such member’s Section | Notice. For purposes of clarity, if the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries consummates such New Issuance and the total number of Offered
(d)

Securities to be sold is less than the number set forth in the New Issuance Notice, then each electing member shall purchase such electing
member’s Pro Rata Share or such lesser percentage set forth in such member’s Section 1 Notice based on such reduced number of Offered
Securities. Any New Issuance shall be consummated on the later of (a) the proposed issuance date for such New Issuance set forth in the New
Issuance Notice and (b)the fifth (Sth) Business Day following the date on which all regulatory and governmental licenses, registrations,
approvals and consents required for the New Issuance are received and all applicable waiting periods have expired or been waived or
terminated ( provided , however , that the Company and the electing members shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such licenses, registrations, approvals or consents). If any of the members fails to exercise its preemptive rights under this Section 1| or elects to
exercise such rights with respect to less than such member’s full Pro Rata Share (the difference between such member’s Pro Rata Share and the
number of Offered Securities for which such member exercised its preemptive rights under this Section 1, the “ Excess Shares ”’), any
participating member electing to exercise its rights with respect to its full Pro Rata Share (a “ Fully Participating Member ”’) shall be entitled to
purchase from the Company an additional number of Offered Securities up to the aggregate number of Excess Shares, provided that such Fully
Participating Member shall only be entitled to purchase up to that number of Excess Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the number of Excess
Shares it has elected to purchase and (ii) the number of Excess Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of Excess Shares and (B) the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the total number of Ordinary Shares then owned by such Fully Participating Member by (2) the total number
of Ordinary Shares then owned by all Fully Participating Members exercising their rights pursuant to this sentence (assuming the conversion of
all Preference Shares held by the Fully Participating Members into Ordinary Shares in each of clauses (1) and (2) above).

 

If the members do not elect to purchase all of the Offered Securities in accordance with this Section 1, then the Company may, within 90 days
from the date of delivery of the New Issuance Notice, offer, sell or otherwise Transfer any remaining portion of the Offered Securities to any
Person or Persons at a price or prices equal to or greater than the Offering Price and on other terms and conditions not more favorable in the
aggregate to the other purchasers than those set forth in the New Issuance Notice. If more than 90 days elapse from the date of delivery of the
New Issuance Notice without the consummation of such Transfer of the remaining portion of the Offered Securities, the Company’s right to
consummate such Transfer shall expire and the Company shall be required to comply with the procedures set forth in this Section | prior to
offering, selling or otherwise transferring to any Person the Offered Securities. The election by a member not to exercise its preemptive rights
under this

21
(e)

(f)

(g)

Section | in any one instance shall not affect its right (other than in respect of a reduction in its Pro Rata Share) as to any future New Issuances
under this Section 1.

Any New Issuance without first giving the members the rights described in this Section 1 shall be void ab initio and of no force and effect. The
preemptive rights of a member hereunder may not be transferred, sold, assigned or otherwise disposed of, except to a Permitted Transferee of
such member, and any purported disposition in violation hereof shall be void and of no force or effect.

There shall be no liability on the part of the Company, the Board of Directors or any member if a New Issuance is not consummated for
whatever reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the determination of whether to effect a New Issuance shall be in the sole and absolute discretion
of the Board of Directors.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the preemptive rights of the members under this Section | shall be deemed satisfied
with respect to any issuance of Offered Securities if within thirty (30) days following the sale of any Offered Securities by the Company to one
or more Persons who are not, in each case, a holder of at least 3% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (assuming the conversion of all
Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares) or an Affiliate of such holder (each, an “ Initial Purchaser ’’), the Company offers to sell to each
member on the same terms (including the price per share) as the Initial Purchasers purchased such Offered Securities the number of Offered
Securities which each member (other than any Initial Purchasers) would have been entitled to purchase with respect to such issuance of Offered
Securities pursuant to Section 1(a).

Effect of Permitted Transfer . Subject to the terms of this Article II and the Shareholders Agreement (including Section 4.1(c) of the Shareholders
Agreement), a Permitted Transferee of a member shall be substituted for and shall enjoy the same rights and be subject to the same obligations as the
transferring member hereunder with respect to the shares Transferred to such Permitted Transferee.

Right of First Offer .

(a)

In the event that any member wishes to Transfer after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing or a New Member wishes to Transfer in
accordance with Section 2(i) (such member or New Member, a “ Transferor”’), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, shares to
any person, such Transferor, prior to any such Transfer, shall deliver to the Company and the non-Transferring members (collectively, the “
ROFO

28
(b)

(d)

Recipients ”’) written notice (the “‘ Offer Notice ”’) stating (i) such Transferor’s intention to effect such a Transfer; (ii) the number of shares
proposed to be transferred by the Transferor (the “ Transferred Shares ”’); and (iii) the material terms and conditions of such sale (including the
per share purchase price (the “‘ Offer Price ’’)); and (iv) the proposed effective date of the sale. The failure to provide an Offer Notice shall not
relieve such Transferor’s obligations and shall not limit the rights of the Company and the non-Transferring shareholders under this Section 5.

For a period often (10) Business Days (the “ Initial Exercise Period ”’) after the last date on which the Offer Notice is deemed to have been
delivered to the Company and the non-Transferring members, the Company shall have the right to purchase up to all of the Transferred Shares
on the same terms and conditions as specified in the Offer Notice and as set forth in this Section 5. In order to exercise its right hereunder, the
Company must deliver written notice to such Transferor within the Initial Exercise Period.

Subject to the limitations of this Section 5(c), if the Company declines to purchase all of the Transferred Shares, then the non-Transferring
members shall have the right on a pro-rata basis (assuming the conversion of all Preference Shares) to elect to purchase, during the Initial
Exercise Period, up to all of the Transferred Shares after giving effect to those Transferred Shares elected to be purchased by the Company (the
“ Remaining ROFO Shares ”’), on the same terms and conditions as specified in the Offer Notice and as set forth in this Section 5. In order to
exercise its rights hereunder, such non-Transferring member must provide written notice delivered to the Transferor within the Initial Exercise
Period. To the extent the aggregate number of shares that the non-Transferring members desire to purchase (as evidenced in the written notices
delivered to such Transferor) exceeds the Remaining ROFO Shares, each non-Transferring member so exercising shall be entitled to purchase
the lesser of (x) the number of Remaining ROFO Shares it so elected to purchase and (y) its pro rata share of the Remaining ROFO Shares,
which shall be equal to that number of the Remaining ROFO Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Remaining
ROFO Shares by (y) a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares held by such non-Transferring member on
the date of the Offer Notice and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Shares held on the date of the Offer Notice by
the non-Transferring member exercising their rights to purchase under this Section 5 (assuming the conversion of all Preference Shares into
Ordinary Shares in each of the numerator and the denominator).

Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration of the Initial Exercise Period or (ii) the time when such Transferor has received written
confirmation from the Company or all of the non-Transferring members (if the Company is not purchasing all of the Transferred Shares)
regarding its

29
(e)

(f)

(g)

exercise of its right of first offer, the Company and the non-Transferring Members shall be deemed to have made its election with respect to the
Transferred Shares. If the Company and/or the non-Transferring members, after following the procedures set forth in Section 5(b) and

Section 5(c), elected to acquire all of the Transferred Shares, then within five (5) days after the expiration of the Initial Exercise Period, such

be purchased by the Company pursuant to Section 5(b) and, if applicable, the number of Transferred Shares that will be purchased by each non-
Transferring members pursuant to Section 5(c) (the ‘““ ROFO Confirmation Notice ”’). For purposes of clarity, if the Company and/or the non-
Transferring members did not elect to acquire all of the Transferred Shares, then the Company and the non-Transferring members shall not
have any right to purchase any Transferred Shares pursuant to this Section 5 and the Transferor shall be free to sell all Transferred Shares to a

Tag-Along Rights .

(a)

(b)

(c)

In the event that any of the Existing Members, individually or as a group (the “ Selling Members ”’), shall Transfer, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, any of its or their Ordinary Shares (a “ Tag-Along Sale ”) to any Person (a “ Proposed Purchaser ”’), each other
member (each, a “ Tagging Member ”’) shall have the right and option (“ Tag-Along Rights ”), but not the obligation, to Transfer up to the
Requisite Percentage (as defined below) of its Ordinary Shares in such Tag-Along Sale, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6.
For the avoidance of doubt, members may only exercise their Tag-Along Rights under this Section 6 in respect of Ordinary Shares (and not any
other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Ordinary Shares, including any Preference Shares). Upon the consummation
of any Tag-Along Sale which, individually or together with all other related Tag-Along Sales involving a single purchaser or group of
purchasers, constitutes a Company Sale, before any distribution or payment shall be made to any Selling Members in connection with such
Tag-Along Sale, each Tagging Member holding Preference Shares shall be entitled to receive the Sale Payment for each of its Preference Share
being sold or converted in connection with such Tag-Along Sale in accordance with the Memorandum.

The Selling Members shall notify the Tagging Members in writing of any proposed Tag-Along Sale at least twenty (20) days prior to the
anticipated closing date for such proposed Tag-Along Sale (a “ Tag-Along Notice”). Any such Tag-Along Notice delivered to the Tagging
Members in connection with a proposed Tag-Along Sale shall set forth: (i) the number of Ordinary Shares the Selling Members are selling in
connection with such Tag-Along Sale (the “ Offered Tag-Along Sale Shares ”’), (ii) the name and address of the Proposed Purchaser in such
Tag-Along Sale, (iii) the material terms and conditions of such proposed Tag-Along Sale (including the per Ordinary Share purchase price and
description of any proposed purchase price adjustments) and (iv) the proposed effective date of the proposed Tag-Along Sale.

 

Each Tagging Member shall have the right to include in the Tag-Along Sale and the Selling Member shall cause the inclusion in the Tag-Along
Sale, upon the terms set forth in the Tag-Along Notice, up to that number of Ordinary Shares equal to a percentage of the total number of
Ordinary Shares proposed to be sold by the Selling Members determined by dividing (A) the total number of Ordinary Shares then owned by
such Tagging Member by (B) the sum of (x) the total number of Ordinary Shares then owned by all Tagging Members exercising their rights
pursuant to this Section 6 and (y) the total number of Ordinary Shares owned by the Selling Members (assuming the conversion of all
Preference Shares held by the Tagging Members and the Selling Members into

31
(d)

 

Ordinary Shares in each of clauses (x) and (y)) (the “ Requisite Percentage ”’); provided , that if such calculation yields a fraction of an
Ordinary Share, such fraction shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Ordinary Share if such fraction is equal to or greater than 0.5 and
rounded down to the nearest whole Ordinary Share if such fraction is less than 0.5. The Tagging Members may exercise the Tag-Along Rights
in connection with a Tag-Along Sale described in a Tag-Along Notice by delivery of a written notice to the Selling Members within ten

(10) days following receipt of a Tag-Along Notice from such Selling Members. Each Tagging Member shall be deemed to have waived its
Tag-Along Rights if it fails to give notice within the prescribed time period.

In the event that any Tagging Member does not exercise its Tag-Along Rights or elects to exercise its Tag-Along Rights with respect to less
than all of its Requisite Percentage (such remaining securities, the “ Non-Electing Shares ’’), each other Tagging Member who has elected to
exercise its Tag-Along Rights in full, may elect to sell (in addition to its Requisite Percentage of the number of Ordinary Shares proposed to be
sold by the Selling Members) up to the total number of Non-Electing Shares, provided that such Tagging Member shall only be entitled to sell
up to that number of Non-Electing Shares equal to the lesser of (i) the number of Non-Electing Shares it has elected to sell and (ii) its pro rata
share of Non-Electing Shares, which shall equal to that number of Non-Electing Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of Non-Electing
Shares and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the total number of Ordinary Shares then owned by such Tagging Member by (2) the sum
of (x) the total number of Ordinary Shares then owned by all Tagging Members exercising their rights pursuant to this Section 6(d) (excluding
the Non-Electing Shares) and (y) the total number of Ordinary Shares owned by the Selling Members (assuming the conversion of all
Preference Shares held by the Tagging Members and the Selling Members into Ordinary Shares in each of clauses (x) and (y)). The Selling
Members shall attempt to obtain inclusion in the Tag-Along Sale of the entire number of shares which the Selling Members and the Tagging
Members electing to exercise Tag-Along Rights desire to have included in the Tag-Along Sale. In the event the Selling Members shall be
unable to obtain the inclusion of such entire number of shares in such Tag-Along Sale, the number of shares to be sold in the Tag-Along Sale
by each Selling Member and each Tagging Member electing to exercise Tag-Along Rights shall be reduced on a pro rata basis according to the
proportion which the number of shares which each such party desires to have included in the sale bears to the total number of shares desired by
all such parties to have included in the sale, and the Transfer to the Proposed Purchaser will otherwise proceed in accordance with the terms of
this Section 6 and the Tag-Along Notice.

32
(e)

In the event that the Tagging Members shall elect to exercise Tag-Along Rights in connection with a proposed Tag-Along Sale, the Tagging
Members shall take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable action, and do, or cause to be done, all things commercially reasonable
to consummate and make effective such Tag-Along Sale, including executing any purchase agreement or other certificates, instruments and
other agreement required to consummate the proposed Transfer to the Proposed Purchaser and using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary consents from third parties and take such other actions as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of the foregoing so long as
such Selling Members execute the same agreements and other documents on the same terms, provided that:

(i)

(il)

(iii)

(iv)

a Tagging Member shall not be required to provide representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements other than those individual
representations, warranties covenants, or agreements (so long as such Selling Members agree to do the same) related to such Tagging
Member’s (A) ownership of and title to the shares it is transferring in such Tag-Along Sale, (B) organization, (C) authority to enter in
the Tag-Along Sale and (D) conflicts and consents related to such Tag-Along Sale;

any indemnity given by the Selling Members to the purchaser in connection with such Tag-Along Sale applicable to liabilities not
specific to the Selling Members shall be apportioned among the Selling Members and the Tagging Members according to the
consideration received by each Selling Member and Tagging Member and shall not exceed the lesser of (A) such Selling Member’s or
Tagging Member’s (as the case may be) pro rata portion of any such liability, to be determined in accordance with such Selling
Member’s or Tagging Member’s (as the case may be) portion of the total value for his, her or its Ordinary Shares included in such Tag-
Along Sale or (B) such Selling Member’s or Tagging Member’s (as the case may be) proceeds from the Tag-Along Sale;

other than a customary confidentiality covenant, a Tagging Member shall not be obligated to enter into any non-compete, non-solicit or
other post-closing covenant that restricts its activities in any way; and

a Tagging Member shall not be responsible for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements made by any other
seller in such Tag-Along Sale with respect to such other seller.

33
Subject to clauses (i) through (iv) above, at the closing of any Tag-Along Sale, the Tagging Members shall deliver to the Proposed Purchaser
(A) such instruments of transfer as shall be reasonably requested by the Proposed Purchaser with respect to the Ordinary Shares to be
Transferred, against receipt of the purchase price therefor (so long as such Selling Members agree to do the same) and (B) such members’
Ordinary Shares, free and clear of any liens (so long as such Selling Members agree to do the same). At the closing of any proposed Tag-Along
Sale, the Proposed Purchaser shall deliver payment (in full in immediately available funds) for the Ordinary Shares purchased by such
Proposed Purchaser.

(f) In connection with any Tag-Along Sale, the Tagging Members shall receive for the sale of their Ordinary Shares a pro rata portion of the
aggregate consideration paid by the Proposed Purchaser.

(g) There shall be no liability on the part of the Board of Directors, the Selling Members or the Company to the Tagging Members or any of their
respective Affiliates if any Tag-Along Sale is not consummated for whatever reason. For the avoidance of doubt, the determination of whether
to effect a Tag-Along Sale shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of the Selling Members.

(h) This Section 6 shall not apply to Transfers (i) permitted by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (g), (h) and (4) of Section 20, (ii) in connection with a
liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Company, (iii) pursuant to, or consequent upon, the exercise of the right of first offer set forth in

Company shall be at the disposal of the Board of Directors who may, without limiting or affecting any rights previously conferred on the holders of
any existing shares or class or series of shares offer, allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of shares to such persons, at such times and upon
such terms and conditions as the Company may by resolution of directors determine.

No share in the Company may be issued until the consideration in respect thereof is fully paid, and when issued the share is for all purposes fully paid
and non-assessable save that a share issued for a promissory note or other written obligation for payment of a debt may be issued subject to forfeiture
in the manner prescribed in these Articles.

Shares in the Company shall be issued for money, services rendered, personal property, an estate in real property, a promissory note or other binding
obligation to contribute money or property or any combination of the foregoing as shall be determined by a resolution of directors.

Shares in the Company may be issued for such amount of consideration as the Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution of directors
determine, except that in the case of shares with par value, the amount shall not be less than the par value, and in the absence of fraud the decision of
the Board of Directors as to the value of the consideration received by the Company in respect of the issue is conclusive unless a question of Law is
involved. The consideration in respect of the shares constitutes capital to the extent of the par value and the excess constitutes surplus.

A share issued by the Company upon conversion of, or in exchange for, another share or a debt obligation or other security in the Company, shall be
treated for all purposes as having been issued for money equal to the consideration received or deemed to have been received by the Company in
respect of the other share, debt obligation or security.

Treasury shares may be disposed of by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise inconsistent with these Articles) as the Company
may by resolution of directors determine.

The Company may issue fractions of a share and a fractional share shall have the same corresponding fractional liabilities, limitations, preferences,
privileges, qualifications, restrictions, rights and other attributes of a whole share of the same class or series of shares.

Upon the issue by the Company of a share without par value, the consideration in respect of the share constitutes capital to the extent designated by
the Board of Directors and the excess constitutes surplus, except that the Board of Directors must designate as capital an amount of the consideration
that is at least equal to

the amount that the share is entitled to as a preference, if any, in the assets of the Company upon liquidation of the Company.

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own shares but only out of surplus or in exchange for newly issued shares of
equal value.

Subject to provisions to the contrary in the Memorandum or these Articles, the Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own
shares without the consent of members whose shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired.

No purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares shall be made unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution of directors that
immediately after the purchase, redemption or other acquisition Company will be able to satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary
course of its business and the realisable value of the assets of the Company will not be less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred
taxes, as shown in the books of account, and its capital and, in the absence of fraud, the decision of the Board of Directors as to the realisable value of
the assets of the Company is conclusive, unless a question of Law is involved.

A determination by the Board of Directors under the preceding Regulation is not required where shares are purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired

(a) pursuant to a right of a member to have his shares redeemed or to have his shares exchanged for money or other property of the Company;

(b) _ by virtue of a transfer of capital pursuant to Regulation 49;

(c) by virtue of the provisions of the Act; or

(d) pursuant to an order of the Court.

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to the preceding Regulation may be cancelled or held as treasury shares
except to the extent that such shares are in excess of 80 percent of the issued shares of the Company in which case they shall be cancelled but they
shall be available for reissue.

Where shares in the Company are held by the Company as treasury shares or are held by another company of which the Company holds, directly or
indirectly, shares having more than 50 percent of the votes in the election of directors of the other company, such shares of the Company are not

entitled to vote or to have dividends paid thereon and shall not be treated as outstanding for any purpose except for purposes of determining the
capital of the Company.

with, the terms of

(a) | the Memorandum or these Articles; or
(b) awritten agreement for the subscription for the shares to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired.
The Company may by a resolution of directors include in the computation of surplus for any purpose the unrealised appreciation of the assets of the

Company, and, in the absence of fraud, the decision of the Board of Directors as to the value of the assets is conclusive, unless a question of Law is
involved.

MORTGAGES AND CHARGES OF REGISTERED SHARES

Members may mortgage or charge their registered shares in the Company and upon satisfactory evidence thereof the Company shall give effect to the
terms of any valid mortgage or charge except insofar as it may conflict with any requirements herein contained for consent to the transfer of shares.

holder of such shares

FORFEITURE

When shares issued for a promissory note or other written obligation for payment of a debt have been issued subject to forfeiture, the provisions set
forth in the following four regulations shall apply.

Written notice specifying a date for payment to be made and the shares in respect of which payment is to be made shall be served on the member who
defaults in making payment pursuant to a promissory note or other written obligations to pay a debt.

The written notice specifying a date for payment shall

(a) name a further date not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice on or before which payment required by the
notice is to be made; and

(b) contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or before the time named in the notice the shares, or any of them, in respect of which
payment is not made will be liable to be forfeited.

Where a written notice has been issued and the requirements have not been complied with within the prescribed time, the Board of Directors may at
any time before tender of payment forfeit and cancel the shares to which the notice relates.

The Company is under no obligation to refund any monies to the member whose shares have been forfeited and cancelled pursuant to these
provisions. Upon forfeiture and cancellation of the shares the member is discharged from any further obligation to the Company with respect to the
shares forfeited and cancelled.

LIEN

The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share issued for a promissory note or for any other binding obligation to contribute
money or property or any combination thereof to the Company, and the Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every share standing
registered in the name of a member, whether singly or jointly with any other person or persons, for all the debts and liabilities of such member or his
estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such
member, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint
debts or liabilities of such member or his estate and any other person, whether a member of the Company or not. The Company’s lien on a share shall
extend to all dividends payable thereon. The Board of Directors may at any time either generally, or in any particular case,

18
36.

37.

38.

39.

40.

waive any lien that has arisen or declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this Regulation.

In the absence of express provisions regarding sale in the promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute money or property, the Company
may sell, in such manner as the Board of Directors may by resolution of directors determine, any share on which the Company has a lien, but no sale
shall be made unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor until the expiration of twenty one days after a notice in
writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to sell in default of such payment, has been
served on the holder for the time being of the share.

The net proceeds of the sale by the Company of any shares on which it has a lien shall be applied in or towards payment of discharge of the
promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute money or property or any combination thereof in respect of which the lien exists so far as
the same is presently payable and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior
to the sale) be paid to the holder of the share immediately before such sale. For giving effect to any such sale the Board of Directors may authorise
some person to transfer the share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the share and he shall not be bound
to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in
reference to the sale.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Subject to any limitations in these Articles and the Memorandum, registered shares in the Company may be transferred by a written instrument of
transfer signed by the transferor and containing the name and address of the transferee, but in the absence of such written instrument of transfer the
Board of Directors may accept such evidence of a transfer of shares as they consider appropriate.

The Company shall not be required to treat a transferee of a registered share in the Company as a member until the transferee’s name has been
entered in the share register.

Subject to any limitations in these Articles, the Memorandum, the Shareholders Agreement and the Voting and Lock-up Agreement, the Company
must on the application of the transferor or transferee of a registered share in the Company enter in the share register the name of the transferee of the
share save that the registration of transfers may be suspended and the share register closed at such times and for such periods as the Company may
from time to time by resolution of directors determine provided always that such registration shall not be

19
41.

42.

43.

44.

45.

suspended and the share register closed for more than 60 days in any period of 12 months.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

The executor or administrator of a deceased member, the guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only
person recognised by the Company as having any title to his share but they shall not be entitled to exercise any rights as a member of the Company
until they have proceeded as set forth in the next following three regulations.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or confirmation as
executor, of a deceased member or of the appointment of a guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member may be accepted
by the Company even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the document evidencing
the grant of probate or letters of administration, confirmation as executor, appointment as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy is issued by a foreign
court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter. For the purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such
a matter the Board of Directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The Board of Directors may also require an indemnity to be given by the
executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of Law or otherwise to a share or shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any
member may be registered as a member upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the Board of Directors. An application
by any such person to be registered as a member shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transfer of shares of the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt
member and the Board of Directors shall treat it as such.

Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any member may, instead of
being registered himself, request in writing that some person to be named by him be registered as the transferee of such share or shares and such
request shall likewise be treated as if it were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court having regard to all the relevant evidence and the
circumstances of the case.

Subject to any limitations in these Articles or the Memorandum, the Company may by a resolution of directors amend the Memorandum to increase
or reduce its maximum authorised number of shares and in connection therewith the Company may in respect of any unissued shares increase or
reduce the number of such shares, increase or reduce the par value of any such shares or effect any combination of the foregoing.

The Company may amend the Memorandum to
(a) divide the shares, including issued shares, of a class or series into a larger number of shares of the same class or series; or
(b) combine the shares, including issued shares, of a class or series into a smaller number of shares of the same class or series,

provided, however, that where shares are divided or combined under (a) or (b) of this Regulation, the aggregate par value of the new shares must be
equal to the aggregate par value of the original shares.

The capital of the Company may by a resolution of directors be increased by transferring an amount of the surplus of the Company to capital.

Subject to the provisions of the two next succeeding Regulations, the capital of the Company may by resolution of directors be reduced by
transferring an amount of the capital of the Company to surplus.

No reduction of capital shall be effected that reduces the capital of the Company to an amount that immediately after the reduction is less than the
aggregate par value of all outstanding shares with par value and all shares with par value held by the Company as treasury shares and the aggregate of
the amounts designated as capital of all outstanding shares without par value and all shares without par value held by the Company as treasury shares
that are entitled to a preference, if any, in the assets of the Company upon liquidation of the Company.

No reduction of capital shall be effected unless the Board of Directors determine that immediately after the reduction the Company will be able to
satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business and that the realisable assets of the Company will not be less than its
total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in the books of the Company and its remaining capital, and, in the absence of fraud, the decision
of the Board of Directors as to the realisable value of the assets of the Company is conclusive, unless a question of Law is involved.

(b) if all members holding shares entitled to vote on all or any matters to be considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and for

The following shall apply in respect of joint ownership of shares:

(a) if two or more persons hold shares jointly each of them may be present in person or by proxy at a meeting of members and may speak as a
member;

(b) if only one of the joint owners is present in person or by proxy he may vote on behalf of all joint owners; and
(c) if two or more of the joint owners are present in person or by proxy they must vote as one.

A member shall be deemed to be present at a meeting of members if he participates by telephone or other electronic means and all members
participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A meeting of members is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the meeting, there are present in person or by proxy not less than 50 percent of
the votes of the shares or class or series of shares (assuming in the case of Ordinary Shares, any Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of the
Preference Shares) entitled to vote on resolutions of members to be considered at the meeting. If a quorum be present, notwithstanding the fact that
such quorum may be represented by only one person then such person may resolve any matter and a certificate signed by such person accompanied
where such person be a proxy by a copy of the proxy form shall constitute a valid resolution of members.

If within two hours from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of members, shall
be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the next business day at the same time and place or to such other time and place as the

of Directors or if the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not present at the meeting, the members present shall choose someone of their number to
be the Chairman. If the members are unable to choose a Chairman for any reason, then the person representing the greatest number of voting shares
present in person or by prescribed form of proxy at the meeting shall preside as Chairman failing which the oldest individual member or
representative of a member present shall take the chair.

The Chairman may, with the consent of the meeting, adjourn any meeting from time to time, and from place to place, but no business shall be
transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

At any meeting of the members the Chairman shall be responsible for deciding in such manner as he shall consider appropriate whether any
resolution has been carried or not and the result of his decision shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in the minutes thereof. If the
Chairman shall have any doubt as to the outcome of any resolution put to the vote, he shall cause a poll to be taken of all votes cast upon such
resolution, but if the Chairman shall fail to take a poll then any member present in person or by proxy who disputes the announcement by the
Chairman of the result of any vote may immediately following such announcement demand that a poll be taken and the Chairman shall thereupon
cause a poll to be taken. If a poll is taken at any meeting the result thereof shall be duly recorded in the minutes of that meeting by the Chairman.

Any person other than an individual shall be regarded as one member and subject to the specific provisions hereinafter contained for the appointment
of representatives of such persons the right of any individual to speak for or represent such member shall be determined by the Law of the jurisdiction
where, and by the documents by which, the person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of doubt, the Board of Directors may in good faith
seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the Board of Directors may

to exercise the same power on behalf of the person which he represents as that person could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.

The Chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any person other than an individual may call for a notarially certified
copy of such proxy or authority which shall be produced within 7 days of being so requested or the votes cast by such proxy or on behalf of such

outstanding Ordinary Shares held by such holders of Preference Shares (assuming all Preference Shares are converted into Ordinary Shares) shall
have the right to designate the replacement for the Springing Board Seat to fill any such vacancy. A vacancy occurs through the death, resignation or
removal of a director but a vacancy or vacancies shall not be deemed to exist where one or more directors shall resign after having appointed his or
their successor or successors. The director in respect of the Springing Board Seat shall resign immediately prior to, and conditioned upon, the

Company, on the other hand, or make or enter into any agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding to do or cause to be done any of
the foregoing, unless such transaction is to be consummated on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company or its subsidiary (as
applicable) than could be obtained in a transaction effected with an unaffiliated third party on an arm’s-length basis by the Company or its
subsidiary (as applicable) as determined by a majority of the non-interested members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable discretion;
provided, however, that this clause 93(a) shall not apply to any:

The Company shall provide each holder of Preference Shares with written notice (which notice will include a summary of terms) ten days prior to it
or its subsidiary taking any action that requires the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Preference

directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days notice of meetings of the Board of Directors, but a meeting of the Board of Directors held without 3

meeting and for this purpose, the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver on his part.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and an alternate is entitled to attend meetings in the absence of
the director who appointed him and to vote or consent in place of the director.

A meeting of the Board of Directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of the meeting there are present in person or by
alternate not less than one half of the total number of directors, unless there are only 2 directors in which case the quorum shall be 2.

director shall have full power to represent and act for the Company in all matters as are not by the Act or the Memorandum or these Articles required
to be exercised by the members of the Company and in lieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all
matters requiring a resolution of directors. Such a note or memorandum shall constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

directors or a committee of the Board of Directors consented to in writing or by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile or other written electronic
communication by all directors or all members of the committee as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the form

provisions of these Articles regulating the proceedings of the Board of Directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the

officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board of Directors, a Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, a President and one or more Vice
Presidents, Secretaries and Treasurers and such other officers as may from time to time be deemed desirable. Any number of offices may be held by
the same person.

The officers shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed at the time of their appointment subject to any modification in such duties as may be
prescribed thereafter by resolution of directors or resolution of members, but in the absence of any specific allocation of duties it shall be the
responsibility of the Chairman of the Board of Directors to preside at meetings of the Board of Directors and members, the Vice Chairman to act in

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

No agreement or transaction between the Company and one or more of its directors or any person in which any director has a financial interest or to
whom any director is related, including as a director of that other person, is void or voidable for this reason only or by reason only that the director is
present at the meeting of the Board of Directors or at the meeting of the committee of the Board of Directors that approves the agreement or
transaction or that the vote or consent of the director is counted for that purpose if the material facts of the interest of each director in the agreement
or transaction and his interest in or relationship to

32
112.

113.

114.

115.

116.

117.

any other party to the agreement or transaction are disclosed in good faith or are known by the other directors.

A director who has an interest in any particular business to be considered at a meeting of the Board of Directors or members may be counted for
purposes of determining whether the meeting is duly constituted.

INDEMNIFICATION

Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company may indemnify against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings any person who

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, an officer or a liquidator of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The Company may only indemnify a person if the person acted honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and, in the
case of criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

The decision of the Board of Directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company
and as to whether the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful, is in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes
of these Articles, unless a question of Law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

If a person to be indemnified has been successful in defence of any proceedings referred to above the person is entitled to be indemnified against all
expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amount paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by the person in connection
with the proceedings.

33
118.

119.

120.

121.

122.

123.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is or was a director, an officer or a liquidator of the Company, or
who at the request of the Company is or was serving as a director, an officer or a liquidator of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another
company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against the person and incurred by the person in that
capacity, whether or not the Company has or would have had the power to indemnify the person against the liability as provided in these Articles.

SEAL

The Company may have more than one Seal and references herein to the Seal shall be references to every Seal which shall have been duly adopted by
resolution of directors. The Board of Directors shall provide for the safe custody of the Seal and for an imprint thereof to be kept at the Registered
Office. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein the Seal when affixed to any written instrument shall be witnessed and attested to by the
signature of a director or any other person so authorised from time to time by resolution of directors. Such authorisation may be before or after the
seal is affixed may be general or specific and may refer to any number of sealings. The Board of Directors may provide for a facsimile of the Seal and
of the signature of any director or authorised person which may be reproduced by printing or other means on any instrument and it shall have the
same force and validity as if the Seal had been affixed to such instrument and the same had been signed as hereinbefore described.

DIVIDENDS

The Company may by a resolution of directors declare and pay dividends in money, shares, or other property but dividends shall only be declared and
paid out of surplus. In the event that dividends are paid in specie the Board of Directors shall have responsibility for establishing and recording in the
resolution of directors authorising the dividends, a fair and proper value for the assets to be so distributed.

The Board of Directors may from time to time pay to the members such interim dividends as appear to the Board of Directors to be justified by the
profits of the Company.

The Board of Directors may, before declaring any dividend, set aside out of the profits of the Company such sum as they think proper as a reserve
fund, and may invest the sum so set apart as a reserve fund upon such securities as they may select.

No dividend shall be declared and paid unless the Board of Directors determine that immediately after the payment of the dividend the Company will
be able to satisfy its liabilities as they become due in the ordinary course of its business and

34
124.

125.

126.

127.

128.

129.

130.

131.

the realisable value of the assets of the Company will not be less than the sum of its total liabilities, other than deferred taxes, as shown in its books of
account, and its capital. In the absence of fraud, the decision of the Board of Directors as to the realisable value of the assets of the Company is
conclusive, unless a question of Law is involved.

Notice of any dividend that may have been declared shall be given to each member in manner hereinafter mentioned and all dividends unclaimed for
3 years after having been declared may be forfeited by resolution of directors for the benefit of the Company.

No dividend shall bear interest as against the Company and no dividend shall be paid on treasury shares or shares held by another company of which
the Company holds directly or indirectly, shares having more than 50 percent of the vote in electing directors.

A share issued as a dividend by the Company shall be treated for all purposes as having been issued for money equal to the surplus that is transferred
to capital upon the issue of the share.

In the case of a dividend of authorised but unissued shares with par value, an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares shall be
transferred from surplus to capital at the time of the distribution.

In the case of a dividend of authorised but unissued shares without par value, the amount designated by the Board of Directors shall be transferred
from surplus to capital at the time of the distribution, except that the Board of Directors must designate as capital an amount that is at least equal to
the amount that the shares are entitled to as a preference, if any, in the assets of the Company upon liquidation of the Company.

A division of the issued and outstanding shares of a class or series of shares into a larger number of shares of the same class or series having a
proportionately smaller par value does not constitute a dividend of shares.

ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT

The Company may by resolution of members call for the Board of Directors to prepare periodically a profit and loss account and a balance sheet. The
profit and loss account and balance sheet shall be drawn up so as to give respectively a true and fair view of the profit or loss of the Company for the
financial period and a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial period.

The Company may by resolution of members call for the accounts to be examined by auditors.

meeting of the members of the Company and shall state in a written report whether or not

(a) in their opinion the profit and loss account and balance sheet give a true and fair view respectively of the profit or loss for the period covered
by the accounts, and of the state of affairs of the Company at the end of that period, and

(b) all the information and explanations required by the auditors have been obtained.

The report of the auditors shall be annexed to the accounts and shall be read at the meeting of members at which the accounts are laid before the
Company or shall be served on the members.

Every auditor of the Company shall have a right of access at all times to the books of account and vouchers of the Company, and shall be entitled to
require from the directors and officers of the Company such information and explanations as he thinks necessary for the performance of the duties of
the auditors.

The auditors of the Company shall be entitled to receive notice of, and to attend any meetings of members of the Company as which the Company’s
profit and loss account and balance sheet are to be presented.
