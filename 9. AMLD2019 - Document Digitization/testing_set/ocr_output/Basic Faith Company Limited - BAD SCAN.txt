resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it
thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the Company or of any

to exercise the same powers on behalf of the person which he represents as that
person could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company.

facsimile or other written electronic communication, without the need for any
notice, but if any resolution of members is adopted otherwise than by the

the committee would exercise the power in conformity with the duties imposed
on directors of the Company under the Act.

appointing director or of the alternate director and does not act as an agent of or

relation to taking of decisions by the directors, is as effective as if the powers
were exercised by the appointing director.

director and is subject to the same duties and responsibilities as a director when
acting as such.

For the purposes of Regulation 15.1, a disclosure to all other directors to the
effect that a director is a member, director or officer of another named entity or
has a fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and
is to be regarded as interested in any transaction which may, after the date of the
entry or disclosure, be entered into with that entity or individual, is a sufficient
disclosure of interest in relation to that transaction.

A director of the Company who is interested in a transaction entered into or to be
entered into by the Company may:

15.3.1 vote on a matter relating to the transaction;

15.3.2 attend a meeting of directors at which a matter relating to the
transaction arises and be included among the directors present at the
meeting for the purposes of quorum; and

his capacity as a director, that relates to the transaction.

INDEMNIFICATION
Subject to the limitations hereinafter provided the Company may indemnify
against all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgements, fines and

amounts paid in settlement and reasonably incurred in connection with legal,
administrative or investigative proceedings, any person who

19
16.2

16.3

16.4

16.5

16.6

16.1.1 is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or contemplated proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
the person is or was a director of the Company; or

16.1.2 is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in
any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

The Company may only indemnify a person if the person acted honestly and in
good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and, in the case of
criminal proceedings, the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful. For the purposes of this Sub-Regulation, a director acts in
the best interests of the Company if he acts in the best interests of:

16.2.1 the Company’s holding company; or
16.2.2 | amember or members of the Company;

in either case, in the circumstances specified in Section 120(2), (3) or (4) of the
Act, as the case may be.

The decision of the directors as to whether the person acted honestly and in good
faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the
person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in
the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of these Articles, unless a
question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgement, order, settlement,
conviction or the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act honestly and in good faith and with a
view to the best interests of the Company or that the person had reasonable cause
to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

If a person to be indemnified has been successful in defence of any proceedings
referred to in Regulation 16.1 the person is entitled to be indemnified against all
expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgements, fines and amounts
paid in settlement and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the
proceedings.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person
who is or was a director of the Company, or who at the request of the Company
is Or was serving as a director of, or in any other capacity is or was acting for,
another company or a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
