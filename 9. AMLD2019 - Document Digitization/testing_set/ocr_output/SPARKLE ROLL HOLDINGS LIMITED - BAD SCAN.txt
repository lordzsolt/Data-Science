shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such
member or his estate and any other person, whether a member of the Company or not. The Company’s lien on

in writing, stating and demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the intention to
sell in default of such payment, has been served on the holder for the time being of the share.

payment of discharge of the promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute money or property or
any combination thereof in respect of which the lien exists so far as the same is presently payable and any

money, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference
to the sale,

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Registered shares in the Company are transferred by a written instrument of transfer signed by the transferor
and containing the name and address of the transferee. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by the transferee
if registration as a holder of the share shall impose a liability to the Company on the transferee. The instrument
of transfer of a registered share shall be sent to the Company for registration.

members,

43.

44,

45.

46.

47.

48.

49.

but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve;

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of the shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) _ that the transferee’s name should be entered in the register of members notwithstanding the absence of
the instrument of transfer.

The Company must on the receipt of an instrument of transfer from the transferor or transferee of a registered

share in the Company enter the name of the transferee of the share in the register or members unless the

directors, if permitted by the Memorandum or these Articles, resolve by resolution of directors to refuse or

delay the registration of the transfer for reasons that shall be specified in the resolution of directors.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

The personal representative of a deceased member may transfer a share even though the personal representative
is not a member at the time of the transfer.

The personal representative, executor or administrator of a deceased member, the guardian of an incompetent
member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only person recognized by the Company as having any
title to his share but they shall! not be entitled to exercise any rights as a member of the Company until they
have proceeded as set forth in the next following three Articles.

The production to the Company of any document which is evidence of probate of the will, or letters of
administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased member or of the appointment of a
guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be accepted by the Company
even if the deceased, incompetent or bankrupt member is domiciled outside the British Virgin Islands if the
document evidencing the grant of probate or letters of administration, confirmation as executor, appointment
as guardian or trustee in bankruptcy is issued by a foreign court which had competent jurisdiction in the matter.
For the purpose of establishing whether or not a foreign court had competent jurisdiction in such a matter the
directors may obtain appropriate legal advice. The directors may also require an indemnity to be given by the
executor, administrator, guardian or trustee in bankruptcy.

The Company may enter in the register of members the name of any person becoming entitled by operation of
law or otherwise to a share or shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy upon such
evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the directors.

Any person who has become entitled to a share or shares in consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy
of any member may, instead of being registered himself, request in writing that some person to be named by
him be registered as the transferee of such share or shares and such request shal] likewise be treated as if it
were a transfer.

What amounts to incompetence on the part of a person is a matter to be determined by the court having regard
to all the relevant evidence and the circumstances of the case.

REDUCTION OR INCREASE IN AUTHORISED AND UNISSUED SHARES
The Company may amend the Memorandum to increase the maximum number of shares the Company is
authorised to issue and may in respect of any unissued shares increase or reduce the number of such shares,
increase or reduce the par value of any such shares or effect any combination of the foregoing.
