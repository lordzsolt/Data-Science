in the Register shall be entitled, without payment, to receive one certificate for all such shares of
any one class or several certificates each for one or more of such shares of such class upon
payment for every certificate after the first of such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses as the
Board from time to time determines.

18. Share certificates shall be issued within a reasonable time limit, after allotment
or, except in the case of a transfer which the Company is for the time being entitled to refuse to

up to be cancelled, and shall forthwith be cancelled accordingly, and a new certificate shall be

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
with other Members) for all the debts and liabilities of such Member or his estate to the !@)
Company whether the same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company

of any equitable or other interest of any person other than such Member, and whether the
period for the payment or discharge of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and
notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or liabilities of such Member or his estate and

any other person, whether a Member of the Company or not. The Company’s lien on a
share shall extend to all dividends or other moneys payable thereon or in respect thereof.

The Board may at any time, generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has
arisen or declare any share exempt in whole or in part, from the provisions of this Article.

22. In the absence of express provisions regarding sale in the promissory note or
other binding obligation to contribute money or property, the Company may sell in such
manner as the Board determines any share on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall
be made unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, or the liability
or engagement in respect of which such lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or
discharged nor until the expiration of fourteen clear days after a notice in writing, stating and
demanding payment of the sum presently, payable, or specifying the liability or engagement
and demanding fulfilment or discharge thereof-and giving notice of the intention to sell in
default, has been served on the registered holder for thetime being of the share or the person
entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.

23. The net proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in or
towards payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists, so far as
the same is presently payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities
not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale) be paid to the person entitled
to the share at the time of the sale. To give effect to any such sale the Board may authorise some
person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as
the holder of the shares so transferred and he:shall not be bound to see to the application of the
purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in
the proceedings relating to the sale.

CALL ON SHARES AND FORFEITURE

24. Where a share is not fully paid for on issue, the directors may, subject to the terms on
which the share was issued, at any time serve upon the Member a written notice of call
specifying a date for payment to be made.

25. The written notice of call shall name a further date not earlier than the expiration of
fourteen days from the date of service of the notice on or before which the payment required by
the notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of non-payment at or
before the time named in the notice, the share will be liable to be forfeited.

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
26. Where a notice complying with the foregoing provisions has been issued and the
requirements of the notice have not been complied with, the Directors by Resolution of
Directors may, at any time before tender of payment forfeit and cancel the share to which the
notice relates.

27. Upon forfeiture and cancellation pursuant to this Article, the Company shall be under
no obligation to refund any moneys to that Member and that Member shall be discharged from
any further obligation to the Company as regards the forfeited share.

28. The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any Member willing to advance APP-%
the same, and either in money or money’s worth, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and ©
unpaid or instalments payable upon any shares held by him and upon all or any of the
moneys so advanced (until the same would, but for such advance, become presently
payable) pay interest at such rate (if any) as the Board may decide. The Board may at any

time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such Member not less than one month’s
Notice of its intention in that behalf, unless before the expiration of such notice the amount

so advanced shall have been called up on the shares.in respect of which it was advanced.

Such payment in advance shall not entitle the holder of such.share or shares to participate in
respect thereof in a dividend subsequently declared.

29. When any Share has been forfeited, Notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon
the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the share. No forfeiture shall be invalidated
by any omission or neglect to give such Notice:

30. The Board may accept the surrender of any Share liable to be forfeited hereunder
and, in such case, references in these Articles to forfeiture will include surrender.

31. Any Share so forfeited shall. be deemed:the property of the Company and may be
sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of to such person, upon such terms and in such manner
as the Board determines, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture
may be annulled by the Board on such terms as the Board determines.

32. A declaration by a Director or the Secretary that a Share has been forfeited on a
specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as against all persons
claiming to be entitled to the Share, and such declaration shall (subject to the execution of an
instrument of transfer by the Company if necessary) constitute a good title to the Share, and the
person to whom the Share is disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the Share and shall
not be bound to see to the application of the consideration (if any), nor shall his title to the Share
be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture,
sale or disposal of the Share. When any Share shall have been forfeited, notice of the
declaration shall be given to the Member in whose name it stood immediately prior to the
forfeiture, and an entry of the forfeiture, with the date thereof, shall forthwith be made in the

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
register, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or neglect to give
such notice or make any such entry.

33. Notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid, the Board may at any time,
before any Shares so forfeited shall have been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, permit
the Shares forfeited to be bought back upon the terms of payment of all calls and interest due
upon and expenses incurred in respect of the Share, and upon such further terms (if any) as it
thinks fit.

event of any such transfer, the shareholder requesting such transfer shall bear the cost of
effecting the transfer unless the Board otherwise determines.

(4)

Unless the Board otherwise agrees (which agreement may be on such terms

and subject to such conditions as the Board in its absolute discretion may from time to time
determine, and which agreement the Board shall, without giving any reason therefor, be
entitled in its absolute discretion to give or withhold), no shares upon the Register shall be
transferred to any branch register nor shall shares on any branch register be transferred to

Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the
transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on
his behalf, the authority of that person so to do); and

if applicable, the instrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped.

If the Board refuses to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within two (2)

months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company, send to each of the
transferor and transferee notice of the refusal.

as may be required by the Board, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some
person nominated by him registered: as the transferee thereof. If he elects to become the holder
he shall notify the Company in writing either at the Registration Office or Office, as the case
may be, to that effect. If he elects to have another person registered he shall execute a transfer
of the share in favour of that person. The provisions of these Articles relating to the transfer
and registration of transfers of shares shall apply to such notice or transfer as aforesaid as if the
death or bankruptcy of the Member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer
signed by such Member.

45. A person becoming entitled to a share by.reason of the death or bankruptcy or
winding-up of a Member shall be entitled to the:same dividends and other advantages to which
he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share. However, the Board may, if it
thinks fit, withhold the payment of any dividend payable or other advantages in respect of such
share until such person shall become the registered holder of the share or shall have effectually
transferred such share, but, subject to the requirements of Article 66(2) being met, such a person
may vote at meetings.

(b) so far as it is aware at the end of the relevant period, the Company has not at any
time during the relevant period received any indication of the existence of the

by death, bankruptcy or operation of law; and

(c) the Company, if so required by the rules of the Designated Stock Exchange, has
given notice to, and caused advertisement.in newspapers in accordance with the
requirements of, the Designated Stock Exchange to be made of its intention to

commencing twelve (12) years before the date of publication of the advertisement referred to in
paragraph (c) of this Article and ending at the expiry of the period referred to in that paragraph.

(3) To give effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person to transfer
the said shares and an instrument of transfersigned or otherwise executed by or on behalf of
such person shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the registered holder or the person
entitled by transmission to such shares, and the purchaser shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any irregularity
or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. The net proceeds of the sale will belong to
the Company and upon receipt by the Company of such net proceeds it shall become indebted
to the former Member for an amount equal to such net proceeds. No trust shall be created in
respect of such debt and no interest shall be payable in respect of it and the Company shall not
be required to account for any money earned from the net proceeds which may be employed in
the business of the Company or as it thinks fit. Any sale under this Article shall be valid and

this Article be deemed joint holders thereof.

meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or, as the case
may be, the adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered or at which
the error occurs. Any objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and
shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the
same may have affected the decision of the meeting. The decision of the chairman on such
matters shall be final and conclusive.

attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such power or

appropriate) not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time appointed for holding the
meeting or adjourned meeting at.which the person named in.the instrument proposes to vote
or, in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting, not
less than twenty-four (24) hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in
default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy
shall be valid after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date named in it as the date of
its execution, except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an
adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally held within twelve (12) months
from such date. Delivery of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a Member
from attending and voting in person at the meeting convened and in such event, the instrument
appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.

69. Instruments of proxy shall be in any common form or in such other form as
the Board may approve (provided that this shall not preclude the use of the two-way form)
and the Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with the Notice of any meeting forms of

instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of proxy shall be deemed to tp 3
confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any amendment of a
resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of

proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the
meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

70. A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be

valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the
instrument of proxy or of the authority under which it was executed, provided that no

AP_Legal — 102081267.2

Company.

unless the Board is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately after the payment of the
dividend or distribution, the value of the Company’s assets exceeds its liabilities and the
Company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and the resolution of the Board shall include a
statement to that effect.

129. Except in so far as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any Share App. 3

person and at such address as the holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such

thinks expedient, and in particular may issue certificates in respect of fractions of shares,

distribution of such specific assets, or any part thereof, and may determine that cash payments
shall be made to any Members upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the
rights of all parties, and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to
the Board and may appoint any person to sign any requisite instruments of transfer and other
documents on behalf of the persons entitled to the dividend, and such appointment shall be
effective and binding on the Members. The Board may resolve that no such assets shall be
made available to Members with registered addresses in any particular territory or territories
where, in the absence of a registration statement or other special formalities, such distribution of
assets would or might, in the opinion, of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable and in such
event the only entitlement of the Members aforesaid shall be to receive cash payments as
aforesaid. Members affected as a.result of the foregoing’sentence shall not be or be deemed to
be a separate class of Members for any purpose whatsoever.

which and the latest date and time by which duly completed forms of
election must be lodged in order to be effective;

(iii) the right of election may be exercised in respect of the whole or part of

that portion of the dividend in respect of which the right of election has
been accorded; and

of shares as aforesaid) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect

and in such event the provisions aforesaid shall be read and construed subject to such
determination. Members affected as a result of the foregoing sentence shall not be or be
deemed to be a separate class of Members for any purpose whatsoever.

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
(5) Any resolution declaring a dividend on shares of any class may specify that the
same shall be payable or distributable to the persons registered as the holders of such shares at
the close of business on a particular date, notwithstanding that it may be a date prior to that on
which the resolution is passed, and thereupon the dividend shall be payable or distributable to
them in accordance with their respective holdings so registered, but without prejudice to the

resolution to capitalise all or any part of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of
any reserve or fund whether or not the same is available for distribution and accordingly that
such amount be set free for distribution among the Members or any class of Members who
would be entitled thereto if it were distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions,
on the footing that the same is not paid in cash but is applied either in or towards paying up the
amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares in the Company held by such Members
respectively or in paying up in full unissued shares, debentures or other obligations of the
Company, to be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid up among such Members, or

to any distribution under the last preceding Article and in particular may issue certificates in
respect of fractions of shares or authorise any person to.sell and transfer any fractions or may
resolve that the distribution should be as nearly-as may be practicable in the correct proportion
but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, and may determine that cash payments
shall be made to any Members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient
to the Board. The Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to
participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for giving effect thereto and
such appointment shall be effective and binding upon the Members.

SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS RESERVE

137. The following provisions shall have effect to the extent that they are not
prohibited by and are in compliance with the Statutes:

(1) If, so long as any of the rights attached to any warrants issued by the Company
to subscribe for shares of the Company shall remain exercisable, the Company does any act or

engages in any transaction which, as a result of any adjustments to the subscription price in

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
accordance with the provisions of the conditions of the warrants, would reduce the subscription
price to below the par value (if any) of a share, then the following provisions shall apply:

(a)

(b)

as from the date of such act or transaction the Company shall establish and
thereafter (subject as provided in this Article) maintain in accordance with the
provisions of this Article a reserve (the “Subscription Rights Reserve”) the
amount of which shall at no time be less than the sum which for the time being
would be required to be capitalised and applied in paying up in full the nominal
amount of the additional shares required to be issued and allotted credited as
fully paid pursuant to sub- paragraph (c) below on the exercise in full of all the
subscription rights outstanding and shall apply the Subscription Rights Reserve
in paying up such additional shares in full as and when the same are allotted;

the Subscription Rights Reserve shall not be used for any purpose other than that
specified above unless all other reserves of the Company (other than share
premium account) have been extinguished and will then only be used to make
good losses of the Company if and’so far as is required by law;

upon the exercise ofvall or any-of the subscription rights represented by any
warrant, the relevant subscription rights shall be exercisable in respect of a
nominal amount of shares equal to the amount in cash which the holder of such
warrant is required to pay on exercise of the subscription rights represented
thereby (or, as the case may be the relevant portion thereof in the event of a
partial exercise of the subscription rights) and, in addition, there shall be allotted
in respect of such subscription rights to the exercising warrantholder, credited as
fully paid, such additional nominal amount of shares as is equal to the difference
between:

(i) the said amount in cash which the holder of such warrant is required to
pay on exercise of the subscription rights represented thereby (or, as the
case may be, the relevant portion thereof in the event of a partial exercise
of the subscription rights); and

(ii) the nominal amount of shares in respect of which such subscription rights
would have been exercisable having regard to the provisions of the
conditions of the warrants, had it been possible for such subscription
rights to represent the right to subscribe for shares at less than par and
immediately upon such exercise so much of the sum standing to the
credit of the Subscription Rights Reserve as is required to pay up in full
such additional nominal amount of shares shall be capitalised and
applied in paying up in full such additional nominal amount of shares
which shall forthwith be allotted credited as fully paid to the exercising
warrantholders; and

AP_Legal — 102081267.2
(d) if, upon the exercise of the subscription rights represented by any warrant, the
amount standing to the credit of the Subscription Rights Reserve is not sufficient
to pay up in full such additional nominal amount of shares equal to such
difference as aforesaid to which the exercising warrantholder is entitled, the
Board shall apply any profits or reserves then or thereafter becoming available
(including, to the extent permitted by law, share premium account) for such
purpose until such additional nominal amount of shares is paid up and allotted
as aforesaid and until then no dividend or other distribution shall be paid or
made on the fully paid shares of the Company then in issue. Pending such
payment and allotment, the exercising warrantholder shall be issued by the
Company with a certificate evidencing his right to the allotment of such
additional nominal amount of shares. The rights represented by any such
certificate shall be in registered form and shall be transferable in whole or in part
in units of one share in the like manner as the shares for the time being are
transferable, and the Company shall make such arrangements in relation to the
maintenance of a register therefor and other matters in relation thereto as the
Board may think fit and adequate particulars thereof shall be made known to
each relevant exercising warrantholder upon the issue of such certificate.

(2) Shares allotted pursuant to the provisions of this»Article shall rank pari passu in
all respects with the other shares allotted on the relevant exercise of the subscription rights
represented by the warrant concerned. Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph (1)
of this Article, no fraction of any share shall be allotted on exercise of the subscription rights.

(3) The provision of this Article as to the establishment and maintenance of the
Subscription Rights Reserve shall not,be altered or added to in any way which would vary or
abrogate, or which would have the effect of varying or abrogating the provisions for the benefit
of any warrantholder or class of warrantholders under this Article without the sanction of a
special resolution of such warrantholders or class of warrantholders.

(4) A certificate or report by the auditors for the time being of the Company as to
whether or not the Subscription Rights Reserve is required to be established and maintained
and if so the amount thereof so required to be established and maintained, as to the purposes
for which the Subscription Rights Reserve has been used, as to the extent to which it has been
used to make good losses of the Company, as to the additional nominal amount of shares
required to be allotted to exercising warrantholders credited as fully paid, and as to any other
matter concerning the Subscription Rights Reserve shall (in the absence of manifest error) be
conclusive and binding upon the Company and all warrantholders and shareholders.
