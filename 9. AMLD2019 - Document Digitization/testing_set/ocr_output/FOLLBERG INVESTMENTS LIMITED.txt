meeting to a Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or

participates by telephone or other electronic means and all Shareholders
participating in the meeting are able to hear each other.

A meeting of Shareholders is duly constituted if, at the commencement of the
meeting, there are present in person or by proxy not less than 50 per cent of the
votes of the Shares or class or series of Shares entitled to vote on Resolutions of
Shareholders to be considered at the meeting. A quorum may comprise a single
Shareholder or proxy and then such person may pass a Resolution of Shareholders

Shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting shall preside as chairman failing
which the oldest individual Shareholder or representative of a Shareholder present
shall take the chair.

advice from any qualified person and unless and until a court of competent
jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the directors may rely and act upon such advice
without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the Company.

Any Eligible Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by
resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such individual as it
thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of Shareholders or of any class
of Shareholders, and the individual so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the
same rights on behalf of the Eligible.Person which he represents as that Eligible
Person could exercise if it were an individual.

at any separate meeting of the holders of any class or series of Shares.

but if any Resolution of Shareholders. is adopted otherwise than by the unanimous
written consent of all Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent
to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the
form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders.

Powers of Directors

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or under the
direction or supervision of, the directors of the Company. The directors of the
Company have all the powers necessary for managing, and for directing and
supervising, the business and affairs of the Company. The directors may pay all
expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the incorporation of the
Company and may exercise all such powers of the Company as are not by the Act or
by the Memorandum or the Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders.

Each director shall exercise his powers for a proper purpose and shall not act or
agree to the Company acting in a manner that contravenes the Memorandum, the
Articles or the Act. Each director, in exercising his powers or performing his duties,
shall act honestly and in good faith in what the director believes to be the best
interests of the Company.

If the Company is the wholly owned subsidiary. of a holding company, a director of
the Company may, when.exercising. powers or performing duties as a director, act in
a manner which he believes.is in the best interests of the holding company even
though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

Any director which is. a body corporate may appoint any individual as its duly
authorised representative for the purpose of representing it at meetings of the
directors, with respect to the signing of consents or otherwise.

The continuing directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body.

The directors may by Resolution of Directors exercise all the powers of the Company
to incur indebtedness, liabilities or obligations and to secure indebtedness, liabilities

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by
telephone or other electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are
able to hear each other.

A director shall be given not less than 3 days’ notice of meetings of directors, but a
meeting of directors held without 3 days’ notice having been given to all directors
shall be valid if all the directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend
waive notice of the meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a director at a
meeting shall constitute waiver by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice
of a meeting to a director, or the fact that a director has not received the notice, does
not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a
director and the alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the
director who appointed him and to vote or consent in place of the director until the
appointment lapses or is terminated.

A meeting of directors is duly constituted for all purposes if at the commencement of
the meeting there are present in person or by alternate not less than one-half of the
total number of directors, unless there are only 2 directors in which case the quorum
is 2.

If the Company has only one director the provisions herein contained for meetings of
directors do not apply and.such sole director has full power to represent and act for
the Company in all matters as are not by the Act, the Memorandum or the Articles
required to be exercised by the Shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting the
sole director shall record in writing and sign a note or memorandum of all matters
requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note-or memorandum constitutes
sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

At meetings of directors at which the Chairman of the Board is present, he shall
preside as chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the
Chairman of the Board is not present, the directors present shall choose one of their
number to be chairman of the meeting:

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting
may also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of
directors consented to in writing by all directors or by all members of the committee,
as the case may be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the
form of counterparts each counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the
consent is in one or more counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates,
then the resolution shall take effect on the date upon which the last director has
consented to the resolution by signed counterparts.

Committees
The directors may, by Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees,
each consisting of one or more directors, and delegate one or more of their powers,

including the power to affix the Seal, to the committee.

Sub-Regulation 11.2(6) and (c) do not prevent a committee of directors, where
authorised by the Resolution of Directors appointing such committee or by a
subsequent Resolution of Directors, from appointing a sub-committee and delegating
powers exercisable by the committee to the sub-committee.

The meetings and proceedings of each committee of directors consisting of 2 or
more directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles
regulating the proceedings, of directors so far as the same are not superseded by
any provisions in the Resolution of Directors establishing the committee.

Where the directors delegate their powers to a committee of directors they remain
responsible for the exercise of that power by the committee, unless they believed on
reasonable grounds at all times before the exercise of the power that the committee
would exercise the power in conformity with the duties imposed on directors of the
Company under the Act.

Officers and Agents

The Company may by Resolution of Directors appoint officers of the Company at
such times as may be considered necessary or expedient. Such officers may

presidents, secretaries and treasurers and such other officers as may from time to
time be considered necessary or expedient. Any number of offices may be held by
the same person.

The officers shall perform such duties as are prescribed at the time of their
appointment subject to any modification in such duties as may be prescribed
thereafter by Resolution of Directors. In the absence of any specific prescription of
duties it shall be the responsibility of the Chairman of the Board to preside at
meetings of directors and Shareholders, the president to manage the day to day
affairs of the Company, the vice-presidents to act in order of seniority in the absence
of the president but otherwise to perform such duties as may be delegated to them
by the president, the secretaries to maintain the register of members, minute books
and records (other than financial records) of the Company and to ensure compliance
with all procedural requirements imposed on the Company by applicable law, and the

one or more substitutes or delegates to exercise some or all of the powers conferred
on the agent by the Company. The directors may remove an agent appointed by the
Company and may revoke or vary a power conferred on him.

Conflict of Interests

A director of the Company shall, forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is
interested in a transaction entered into or to be entered into by the Company,
disclose the interest to all other directors of the Company.

For the purposes of Sub-Regulation 13.1, a disclosure to all other directors to the
effect that a director is a member, director or officer of another named entity or has a
fiduciary relationship with respect to the entity or a named individual and is to be
regarded as interested in any transaction which may, after the date of the entry or

13.3.

14.

14.1.

14.2.

14.3.

entered into by the Company may:

(a) vote on a matter relating to the transaction;

(b) attend a meeting of directors at which a matter relating to the transaction
arises and be included among the directors present at the meeting for the
purposes of a quorum; and

and no such transaction shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such
interest or benefit.

all expenses, including legal fees, and against all judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement and reasonably incurred_in connection with legal, administrative or
investigative proceedings any person who:

pending or completed proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or

faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company and as to whether the
person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful is, in the

the entering of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the
person did not act honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of
the Company or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct
was unlawful.

The Company may purchase and maintain insurance in relation to any person who is
or was a director, officer or liquidator of the Company, or who at the request of the
Company is or was serving as a director, officer or liquidator of, or in any other
