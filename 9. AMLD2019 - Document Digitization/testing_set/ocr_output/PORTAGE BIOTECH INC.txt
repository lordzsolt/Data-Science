the Shareholder is discharged from any further obligation to the Company with respect to the Shares
forfeited and cancelled.

TRANSFER OF SHARES

Subject to these Articles, Shares are transferred by a written instrument of transfer.

The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in any usual or common form or such other form as
the Directors may, in their absolute discretion approve and be executed by or on behalf of the
transferor and if in respect of a nil or partly paid up Share, or where the transfer otherwise imposes a
liability to the Company on the transferee, or if so required by the Directors, shall also be executed by
or on behalf of the transferee and shall be accompanied by the certificate (if any) of the Shares to
which it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of
the transferor to make the transfer. The transferor shall be deemed to remain a Shareholder until the
name of the transferee is entered in the Register of members in respect of the relevant Shares.

The registration of transfers may be suspended at such times and for such periods as the Directors
may from time to time determine.

but any instrument of transfer relating to a transfer which the Directors decline to register shall
(except in any case of fraud) be returned to the Person depositing the same.

TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

The legal personal representative of a deceased sole holder of a Share shall be the only Person
recognised by the Company as having any title to the Share. In the case of a Share registered in the
name of two or more holders, the survivors or survivor, or the legal personal representatives of the
deceased survivor, shall be the only Person recognised by the Company as having any title to the
Share.

Any Person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a Shareholder
shall upon such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the Directors, have
the right either to be registered as a Shareholder in respect of the Share or, instead of being registered
himself, to make such transfer of the Share as the deceased or bankrupt Person could have made; but
the Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would

42

have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by the deceased or bankrupt Person before the death
or bankruptcy.

entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if her were the
registered Shareholder, except that he shall not, before being registered as a Shareholder in respect
of the Share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to
meetings of the Company.

ALTERATION OF NUMBER OF AUTHORISED SHARES

The Company may amend the Memorandum to increase or reduce the number of Shares the
Company is authorized to issue.

the same Class or Series; or

of the same Class or Series;

provided, however, that where Shares with a par value are divided or combined under (a) or (b) of
this Article, the aggregate par value of the new Shares must be equal to the aggregate par value of
the original Shares.

REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

The Company may purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire and hold its own Shares in such manner
and upon such other terms as the directors may agree with the relevant Shareholder(s) save that the
Company may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire its own Shares without the consent of
Shareholders whose Shares are to be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired unless the
Company is permitted by the Act or any other provision in the Memorandum or Articles to purchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire the Shares without their consent.

The Company may acquire its own fully paid Share or Shares for no consideration by way of surrender
of the Share or Shares to the Company by the Shareholder holding the Share or Shares. Any surrender
of a Share or Shares under this Article shall be in writing and signed by the Shareholder.

TREASURY SHARES

Shares that the Company purchases, redeems or otherwise acquires pursuant to these Articles shall
be cancelled immediately or held as Treasury Shares in accordance with the Act and Article 41.

Shares may only be purchase, redeemed or otherwise acquired and held as Treasury Shares where,
when aggregated with the number of Shares of the same Class already held by the Company as
Treasury Shares, the total number of Treasury Shares does not exceed 50 percent of the Shares of the
Class previously issued by the Company, excluding those Shares that have been cancelled.

Where and for so long as Shares are held by the Company as Treasury Shares, all rights and obligations
attaching to such Shares are suspended and shall not be exercised by or against the Company.

Treasury Shares may be disposed of by the Company on such terms and conditions (not otherwise
inconsistent with these Articles) as the Company may by Resolution of Directors determine.

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

The Directors may, whenever they think fit, convene a meeting of Shareholders at such times and in
such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the Directors consider necessary
or desirable, but the Directors shall call a meeting of Shareholders designated as an “annual meeting”
not later than eighteen months after the Company’s registration under the laws of the British Virgin
Islands and subsequently not later than fifteen months after holding the last preceding annual
meeting.

Shareholders’ meetings shall also be convened on the requisition in writing of any Shareholder or
Shareholders entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Shareholders of the Company on the
matter for which the meeting is being requested holding at least ten percent of outstanding Shares
entitled to vote in the Company deposited at the Registered Office specifying the objects of the
meeting for a date no earlier than twenty one days from the date of deposit of the requisition signed
by the requisitionists, and if the Directors do not convene such meeting for a date not later than forty
five days after the date of such deposit, the requisitionists themselves may convene the Shareholders’
meeting in the same manner, as nearly as possible, as that in which Shareholders’ meetings may be
convened by the Directors, and all reasonable expenses incurred by the requisitionists as a result of
the failure of the Directors to convene the Shareholders’ meeting shall be reimbursed to them by the
Company.

If at any time there are no Directors, any two Shareholder (or if there is only one Shareholder then
that Shareholder) entitled to vote at meetings of the Shareholders of the Company may convene a
Shareholders’ meeting in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which Shareholders’
meetings may be convened by the Directors.

NOTICE OF MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

provided in these Articles specifying the place, the day and the hour of the meeting and the general

provided to such Persons as are, under these Articles, entitled to receive such notices from the
Company. In addition, notice of the meeting shall be posted on SEDAR at least 25 days before the
record date and at least 65 days before the date of the meeting.

at the meeting the date notice is given of the meeting and may also fix in advance a date as the record
date for determining those Shares that are entitled to vote at the meeting but the record date shall
not precede by more than 60 days or by less than 40 days the date of which the meeting is to be held.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the notice requirements set out above is valid if
Shareholders holding not less than ninety percent majority of the:

(b) votes of each Class of Shares where Shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a Class together
with not less than an absolute majority of the remaining votes,

have waived notice of the meeting and for this purpose presence at the meeting shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver.

The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting by
any Shareholder shall not invalidate the proceedings at any meeting.

PROCEEDINGS AT SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETINGS

No business shall be transacted at any Shareholders’ meeting unless a quorum of Shareholders is

Articles, two or more Shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy,

meeting a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting the
Shareholder or Shareholders present and entitled to vote shall form a quorum.

If the Directors wish to make this facility available for a specific Shareholders’ meeting or all
Shareholders’ meetings of the Company, participation in any Shareholders’ meeting may be by means
of a telephone or by other electronic means provided that all Persons participating in such meeting
are able to hear each other and such participation shall be deemed to constitute presence in person
at the meeting.

The chairman, if any, of the Directors shall preside as chairman at every Shareholders’ meeting.

If there is no such chairman, or if at any Shareholders’ meeting he is not present within fifteen minutes
after the time appointed for holding the meeting or is unwilling to act as chairman, any Director or
Person nominated by the Directors shall preside as chairman, failing which the Shareholders present
in person or by proxy shall choose any Person present to be chairman of that meeting.

The chairman may with the consent of any Shareholders’ meeting at which a quorum is present (and
shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn a meeting from time to time and from place to place, but
no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at
the meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting, or adjourned meeting, is
adjourned for fourteen days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of
an original meeting. Save as aforesaid it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment
or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting.

The Directors may cancel or postpone any duly convened Shareholders’ meeting at any time prior to
such meeting, except for a Shareholders’ meeting requisitioned by the Shareholders in accordance
with these Articles, for any reason or for no reason, upon notice in writing to Shareholders. A
postponement may be for a stated period of any length or indefinitely as the Directors may determine.

At any Shareholders’ meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show
of hands, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) demanded
by the chairman or one or more Shareholders present in person or by proxy entitled to vote, and
unless a poll is so demanded, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has, on a show of hands,
been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect
in the book of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of the fact, without proof
of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of, or against, that resolution.

If a poll is duly demanded it shall be taken in such manner as the chairman directs, and the result of
the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded.

In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman of the
meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall be entitled to
a second or casting vote.

A poll demanded on the election of a chairman of the meeting or on a question of adjournment shall
be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken at such time as the
chairman of the meeting directs.

Shareholders consented to in writing or by telex, telegram, cable, facsimile or other written electronic
communication, without the need for any notice, but if any such resolution is adopted otherwise than
by written consent of a majority of the Shareholders, a copy of such resolution shall forthwith be sent
to all Shareholders not consenting to such resolution. The consent may be in the form of counterparts
in like form each counterpart being signed by one or more Shareholders.

If the Company shall have only one Shareholder the provisions herein contained for meetings of the
Shareholders shall not apply and in lieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in writing and sign a note
or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Shareholders. Such a note or memorandum
shall constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

CORPORATIONS ACTING BY REPRESENTATIVES AT MEETINGS

Any Shareholder or Director that is a corporation or other entity may by resolution of its directors or
other governing body authorise such natural person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any
meeting of the Company or of any meeting of holders of a Class or Series or of the Directors or of a
committee of Directors, and the person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers
on behalf of the corporation or other entity which he represents as that corporation or entity could
exercise if it were an individual Shareholder or Director.

DIRECTORS

The Directors shall be elected by Resolution of Shareholders or, subject to Article 82,appointed by
Resolution of Directors.

No person shall be appointed as a Director of the Company unless he has consented in writing to be
a director.

The Company may by a resolution of Shareholders from time to time fix the maximum and minimum
number of Directors to be appointed but unless such numbers are fixed as aforesaid the minimum

number or Directors shall be one and the maximum number of Directors shall be ten.

Subject to these Articles, the Company may appoint any natural person or corporation to be a
Director. The following are disqualified from appointment as a Director:

(a) an individual who is under eighteen years of age;

(b) a person who is a disqualified person within the meaning of section 260(4) of the Insolvency Act
(or any successor provision);

(c) a person who is a restricted person within the meaning of section 409 of the Insolvency Act (or
any successor provision);

(d) an undischarged bankrupt; and

(e) any other person disqualified by the Memorandum and these Articles.

Each Director holds office for the term, if any, including on an annual basis, fixed by the Resolution of
Shareholders or the Resolution of Directors appointing him or until his earlier death, resignation or
removal. If no term is fixed on the election or appointment of a Director, the Director shall serve for
a term not exceeding the close of the next annual meeting of Shareholders following his election or
appointment.

In the case of a Director who is an individual the term of office of a Director shall terminate on the
Director’s death, resignation, removal or the expiry of any fixed term appointment. The bankruptcy
of a Director or the appointment of a liquidator, administrator or receiver of a corporate Director shall
terminate the term of office of such Director.

A director may be removed from office, with or without cause, by Resolution of Shareholders passed
at a meeting of Shareholders called for the purpose of removing the director or for purposes including
the removal of the director or by a written Resolution of Shareholders. Section 114 of the Act does
not apply to the Company.

A Director may resign his office by giving written notice of his resignation to the Company and the
resignation shall have effect from the date the notice is received by the Company or from such later
date as may be specified in the notice.

Subject to any Resolution of Shareholders to the contrary, the directors may at any time by a
Resolution of Directors appoint any person to be a director either to fill a vacancy (except a vacancy
resulting from an increase in the minimum number of Directors or from a failure of the Shareholders
to elect the minimum number of Directors) or as an addition to the existing Directors. However, the
Directors may not between meeting of Shareholders, appoint an additional Director if, after such
appointment, the total number of Directors would be greater than one and one third time the number
of Directors to have been elected at the last annual meeting of Shareholders. In the absence of a
quorum of the Board of Directors or if the vacancy has arisen from a failure of the Shareholders to
elect the minimum number of Directors, the Board of Directors shall forthwith call a meeting of
Shareholders to fill the vacancy. If the Board of Directors fails to call such meeting or if there are no
such Directors then in office, any Shareholder may call the meeting.

A vacancy in the board of Directors arising as a result of the death of a Director or if a Director
otherwise ceases to hold office prior to the expiration of his stipulated term of office, may be filled by
a Resolution of Shareholders or by a resolution of a majority of the remaining Directors.

The remuneration of the Directors may be determined by a Resolution of Directors? or by a Resolution
of Shareholders.

There shall be no shareholding qualification for Directors unless determined otherwise by a Resolution
of Shareholders.

The Company shall keep a Register of Directors containing the particulars set out in section
118(A)(1)(b) of the Act with respect to corporate directors and the following particulars in the case of
an individual director (or such other particulars as may be prescribed by Act):

(h) nationality.

A copy of the Register of Directors shall be kept at the office of the Registered Agent and filed with
the Registrar and the Company shall, within 30 days of any change occurring, ensure that any changes
in the Register of Directors are filed with the Registrar by arranging the filing of a copy of the Register
of Directors containing the changes.

Where a copy of the Register of Directors is kept at the office of the Registered Agent, the Company
shall within fifteen days of any change in the Register of Directors, notify the Registered Agent in
writing of the change and provide the Registered Agent with a written record of the physical address
of the place at which the original Register of Directors is kept.

ALTERNATE DIRECTOR

Any Director may in writing appoint another person, who need not be a Director, to be his alternate,
provided such person has consented in writing to be an alternate director An alternate Director has
the same rights as the appointing director in relation to any director’s meeting and any written
resolution circulated for written consent. Every such alternate shall therefore be entitled to attend
meetings in the absence of the Director who appointed him and to vote in the place of the Director
and sign written consents. Where the alternate is a Director he shall be entitled to have a separate
vote on behalf of the Director he is representing in addition to his own vote. A Director may at any

an Officer. The remuneration of such alternate shall be payable out of the remuneration of the
Director appointing him and the proportion thereof shall be agreed between them.

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed by, or be under the direction or supervision
of, the Directors who may pay all expenses incurred preliminary to and in connection with the
formation and registration of the Company and may exercise all such powers of the company as are
not by the Act or the Memorandum or these Articles required to be exercised by the Shareholders,
subject to any delegation of such powers as may be authorised by these Articles and to such
requirements as may be prescribed by a Resolution of Shareholders, but no requirement made by a
resolution of Shareholders shall prevail if it be inconsistent with these Articles nor shall such
requirement invalidate any prior act of the Directors which would have been valid if such requirement
had not been made.

Notwithstanding section 175 of the Act, the Directors have the power to sell, transfer, lease,
exchanges or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Company, without restriction and without
complying with the provision of section 175, which shall not apply to the Company.

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, appoint any Person, including a person who is a
Director, to be an Officer or agent of the Company. The Resolution of Directors appointing an agent
may authorise the agent to appoint one or more substitutes or delegates to exercise some or all of
the powers conferred on the agent by the Company.

Every Officer or agent of the Company has such powers and authority of the Directors, including the
power and authority to affix the Seal, as are set forth in these Articles or in the Resolution of Directors
appointing the Officer or agent, except that no Officer or agent has any power or authority with
respect to the matters requiring a Resolution of Directors under the Act or these Articles or are
otherwise not permitted to be delegated under the Act.

All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other negotiable instruments and all
receipts for monies paid to the Company, shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise
executed, as the case may be, in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by Resolution
of Directors.

The Directors may, by a Resolution of Directors, designate one or more committees, each consisting
of one or more Directors.

Each committee of Directors has such powers, and authorities of the Directors, including the power
and authority to affix the Seal, as are set forth in the Resolution of Directors establishing the
committee, except that no committee has any power or authority:

(a) to amend the memorandum or these Articles;

(d) to appoint Directors;

(e) to appoint agents;

(f) to approve a plan of merger, consolidation or arrangement; or
(g) to make a declaration of solvency or approve a liquidation plan.

The Directors may from time to time and at any time by power of attorney (whether under Seal or
under hand or otherwise) appoint any company, firm or Person or body of Persons, whether
nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors, to be the attorney or attorneys or authorized
signatory (any such Person being an “Attorney” or “Authorised Signatory”, respectively) of the
Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those
vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles) and for such period and subject to such
conditions as they may think fit, and any such power of attorney or other appointment may contain
such provisions for the protection and convenience of Persons dealing with any such Attorney or
Authorised Signatory as the Directors may think fit, and may also authorise any such Attorney or
Authorised Signatory to delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretion vested in him.

BORROWING POWERS OF DIRECTORS

The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to mortgage or
charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital or any part thereof, to issue debentures,
debenture stock and other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any debt, liability
or obligation of the Company or of any third party.

DUTIES OF DIRECTORS

Subject to the following Article, the Directors when exercising their powers or performing their duties,
shall act honestly and in good faith and in what the Director believes to be in the best interests of the
Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

52
101.

102.

103.

104.

(a) where the Company is a wholly owned subsidiary, the Directors may, when exercising their
powers or performing their duties as Directors, act in a manner which they believe to be in
the best interests of the Company’s holding company, even though it may not be in the best
interest of the Company;

(b) where the Company is a subsidiary, but not a wholly owned subsidiary, the Directors may,
when exercising their powers or performing their duties, and with the prior agreement of the
Shareholders other than the holding company, act in a manner which they believe to be in
the best interest of the Company’s holding company, even though it may not be in the best
interests of the Company; and

(c) where the Shareholders are carrying out a joint venture, the Directors may, when exercising
their powers or performing their duties in connection with the carrying out of the joint
venture, act in a manner which they believe to be in the best interests of a Shareholder or
Shareholders, even though it may not be in the best interests of the Company.

PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS

The Directors may meet together (either within or outside of the British Virgin Islands) for the
despatch of business, adjourn, and otherwise regulate their meetings and proceedings as they think
fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In case of an equality of
votes the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote. A Director may, and a Secretary or
assistant Secretary on the requisition of a Director shall, at any time summon a meeting of the
Directors.

A Director may participate in any meeting of the Directors, or of any committee appointed by the
Directors of which such Director is a member, by means of telephone or other electronic means
provided that all persons participating in such meeting can hear one other and such participation
shall be deem to constitute presence in person at the meeting.

A Director shall be given not less than two days’ notice of meetings of Directors, but a meeting of
Directors held without two days’ notice having been given to all Directors shall be valid if all the
Directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend, waive notice of the meeting, and for
this purpose, the presence of a Director at the meeting shall be deemed to constitute waiver on his
part. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a Director, or the fact that a Director has
not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

The quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be fixed by the

Directors, and unless so fixed, shall be one-half of the total number of Directors, unless there are only
two directors, in which case, the quorum shall be two. A Director represented by an alternate

53
105.

106.

107.

108.

109.

110.

Director at any meeting shall be deemed to be present for the purposes of determining whether or
not a quorum is present.

If the Company shall have only one Director the provisions herein contained for meetings of the
Directors shall not apply but such sole Director shall have full power to represent and act for the
Company in all matters as are not by the Act or the Memorandum or these Articles required to be
exercised by the Shareholders and in lieu of minutes of a meeting shall record in writing and sign a
note or memorandum of all matter requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or memorandum
shall constitute sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

A Director may hold any other office or place of profit under the Company (other than the office of
auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director for such period and on such terms (as to
remuneration and otherwise) as the Directors may by a Resolution of Directors determine. Any
Director may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company, and he or his firm
shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director; provided that
nothing herein contained shall authorise a Director or his firm to act as auditor to the Company.

The Directors shall cause the following corporate records to be kept:

(a) minutes of all meetings of Directors, Shareholders, committees of Directors, committees of
Officers and committees of Shareholders; and

(b) copies of all resolutions consented to by Directors, Shareholders, Classes of Shareholders,
committees of Directors, committees of Officers and committees of Shareholders.

The above corporate records shall be kept at the office of the Registered Agent, at the Company’s
principal place of business or at such other place as the Directors determine provided that where the
records are kept at a place other than the office of the Registered Agent of the Company, the
Company must provide the Registered Agent with a written record of the physical address of the
place or places at which the records are kept and where such place is changed, the Company shall
provide the Registered Agent with the physical address of the new location of the records within
fourteen days of the change of location.

When the chairman of a meeting of the Directors signs the minutes of such meeting the same shall
be deemed to have been duly held notwithstanding that all the Directors have not actually come
together or what there may have been a technical defect in the proceedings.

An action that may be taken by the Directors or a committee of Directors at a meeting may also be
taken by a resolution of Directors or a committee of Directors consented to in writing or by telex,
telegram, cable, facsimile or other written electronic communication by a simple majority of the
Directors or a simple majority of the members of the committee, as the case may be, without the

54

112.

113.

114.

115.

116.

117.

need for any notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts, each counterpart being signed
by one or more Directors.

The continuing Directors may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body but if and for so long as
their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to these Articles as the necessary
quorum of Directors, the continuing Directors may act for the purpose of increasing the number of
Directors, or of summoning a Shareholders’ meeting, but for no other purpose.

The Directors may elect a chairman of their meetings and determine the period for which he is to
hold office but if no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman is not present within
fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the Directors present may choose
one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

Subject to any regulations imposed on it by the Directors, a committee appointed by the Directors
may elect a chairman of its meetings. If no such chairman is elected, or if at any meeting the chairman
is not present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the committee
members present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

A committee appointed by the Directors may meet and adjourn as it thinks proper. Subject to any
regulations imposed on it by the Directors, questions arising at any meeting shall be determined by
a majority of votes of the committee members present and in case of an equality of votes the
chairman shall have a second or casting vote.

All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of Directors, or by any person acting
as a Director, shall notwithstanding that it be afterwards discovered that there was some defect in
the appointment of any such Director or person acting as aforesaid, or that they or any of them were
disqualified, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed and was qualified to be a
Director.

OFFICERS

The Company may by Resolution of Directors appoint Officers at such times as shall be considered
necessary or expedient. Any number of officers may be held by the same person.

The Officers shall perform such duties as shall be prescribed at the time of their appointment subject
to any modification in such duties as may be prescribed thereafter by Resolution of Directors or
Resolution of Shareholders, but in the absence of any specific allocation of duties it shall be the
responsibility of the chairman of the board of Directors to preside at meetings of Directors and
Shareholders, the vice chairman to act in the absence of the chairman, the president to manage the
day to day affairs of the Company, the vice presidents to act in order of seniority in the absence of
the president but otherwise to perform such duties as may be delegated to them by the president,

Company by applicable law, and the treasurer to be responsible for the financial affairs of the

elected or appointed by the Directors may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by
Resolution of Directors. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Company may be filled by
Resolution of Directors.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

A Director shall forthwith after becoming aware of the fact that he is interested in a transaction
entered into or to be entered into by the Company, disclose the interest to the board of Directors.
Where a Director’s interest in a transaction is not disclosed in accordance with this Article prior to
the transaction being entered into, unless it is not required to be disclosed in accordance with Article
122 below, the transaction is voidable by the Company.

entitled to vote at a meeting of Shareholders and the transaction is approved or ratified by a
Resolution of Shareholders; or

on the basis of the information known to the Company and the interest Director at the time that

office of the Registered Agent.

(b) the Company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due.
Distributions may be paid in money, Shares or other property.

sum as they think proper as a reserve fund, and may invest the sum so set apart as a reserve fund
upon such securities as they may select.

receipt for any Distribution made in respect of such Shares.

“Indemnifiable Person”) who:

(a) is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed

the Person is or was a Director, an Officer, agent or a liquidator of the Company; or

(b) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director, officer, agent or liquidator of,
or in any other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise.

The Company may only indemnify an Indemnifiable Person if such Person acted honestly and in good
faith and in what the Indemnifiable Person believed to be in the best interests of the Company and,

conduct was unlawful, is in the absence of fraud, sufficient for the purposes of these Articles, unless
a question of law is involved.

The termination of any proceedings by any judgment, order, settlement, conviction or the entering
of a nolle prosequi does not, by itself, create a presumption that the Indemnifiable Person did not act
honestly and in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the Company or that such Person
had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by an Indemnifiable Person in defending any legal,
administrative or investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final
disposition of such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnifiable
Person to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnifiable person is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with these Articles.

Expenses, including legal fees, incurred by a former Director, Officer or agent in defending any legal,
administrative or investigative proceedings may be paid by the Company in advance of the final
disposition of such proceedings upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the former Director,
Officer or agent, as the case may be, to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the
former Director, Officer or agent is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company in accordance
with these Articles and upon such other terms and conditions, if any, as the Company deems
appropriate.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section
is not exclusive of any other rights to which the Person seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under the agreement, resolution of members, resolution of disinterested
Directors or otherwise, both as to acting in the Person’s official capacity and as to acting in another
capacity which serving as a Director, if applicable.

If the Company shall be wound up, the liquidator may divide amongst the Shareholders in specie or
kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company (whether they shall consist of property of
the same kind or not) and may, for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any property
to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the
Shareholders of different Classes or Series. The liquidator may vest the whole or any part of such
assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the Shareholders as the liquidator shall think fit,
but so that no Shareholder shall be compelled to accept any asset whereon there is any liability.

Shareholders that are entitled to receive payment of a Distribution, the date of which notice of the
meeting is posted or the date on which the resolution of the Directors declaring such Distribution is
adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of Shareholders. When
