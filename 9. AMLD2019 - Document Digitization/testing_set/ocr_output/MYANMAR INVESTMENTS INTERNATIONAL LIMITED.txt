Shareholders for the purposes of the transfer of Shares. In addition to the foregoing, a
transfer of uncertificated Shares is effective only if a record of the transfer evidencing the
transferor’s consent is available and the statutory particulars in respect of the transferee are
entered in the register of members.

The transferor of any Shares shall remain the holder of those Shares until the name of the
transferee is entered in the register as the holder of those Shares.

If the directors of the Company are satisfied that an instrument of transfer relating to Shares
has been signed but that the instrument has been lost or destroyed, they may resolve by
Resolution of Directors:

(a) to accept such evidence of the transfer of Shares as they consider appropriate; and

(b) that the transferee’s name should be entered. in the register of members
notwithstanding the absence of the instrument of transfer.

Any person becoming entitled by operation of law or otherwise to a Share or Shares in
consequence of the death, incompetence or bankruptcy of any Shareholder may be registered
as a Shareholder upon such evidence being produced as may reasonably be required by the
Directors and, in the case of uncertificated Shares, subject also to the facilities and
requirements of the relevant system concerned. An application by any such person to be
registered as a Shareholder shall for afl purposes be deemed to be a transfer of Shares of the
deceased, incompetent or bankrupt Shareholder and. the Directors shall treat it as such.

Subject to the Memorandum, the personal representative of a deceased Shareholder may
transfer a Share even though the personal representative is not a Shareholder at the time of
the transfer.

MEETINGS AND CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Any director of the Company may convene meetings of the Shareholders at such times and in
such manner and places within or outside the British Virgin Islands as the director considers
necessary or desirable.

Upon the written request of Shareholders entitled to exercise 10 per cent or more of the
voting rights in respect of the matter for which the meeting is requested the directors shall
convene a meeting of Shareholders.

The director convening a meeting shall give not less than fourteen days’ notice of a meeting of

The director convening a meeting of Shareholders may fix as the record date for determining
those Shareholders that are entitled to vote at the meeting the date notice is given of the
meeting, or such other date as may be specified in the notice, being a date not earlier than
the date of the notice.

A meeting of Shareholders held in contravention of the requirement to give notice is valid if
Shareholders holding at least 90 per cent of the total voting rights on all the matters to be
considered at the meeting have waived notice of the meeting and, for this purpose, the
presence of a Shareholder at the meeting shall constitute waiver in relation to all the Shares
which that Shareholder holds.

The inadvertent failure of a director who convenes a meeting to give notice of a meeting to a
Shareholder or another director, or the fact that a Shareholder or another director has not
received notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A Shareholder may be represented at a meeting of Shareholders by a proxy who may speak
and vote on behalf of the Shareholder.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be produced at the place designated for the meeting
before the time for holding the meeting at which the person named in such instrument
proposes to vote. The notice of the meeting may specify an alternative or additional place or
time at which the proxy shall be presented.

The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in substantially the following form or such other
form as the chairman of the meeting shail accept as properly evidencing the wishes of the
Shareholder appointing the proxy. The instrument appointing a proxy may be in electronic
form.

representative of a Shareholder present shall take the chair.

meeting. If the chairman has any doubt as to the outcome of the vote on a proposed
resolution, he shall cause a poll to be taken of all votes cast upon such resolution. If the
chairman fails to take a poll then any Shareholder present in person or by proxy who disputes
the announcement by the chairman of the result of any vote may immediately following such
announcement demand that a poll be taken and the chairman shall cause a poll to be taken.
If a poll is taken at any meeting, the result shall be announced to the meeting and recorded in
the minutes of the meeting.

Subject to the specific provisions contained in this Regulation for the appointment of
representatives of Eligible Persons other than individuals the right of any individual to speak
for or represent a Shareholder shall be determined by the law of the jurisdiction where, and by
the documents by which, the Eligible Person is constituted or derives its existence. In case of
doubt, the directors may in good faith seek legal advice from any qualified person and unless
and until a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise rule, the directors may rely and act
upon such advice without incurring any liability to any Shareholder or the Company.

Any Eligible Person other than an individual which is a Shareholder may by resolution of its
directors or other governing body authorise such individual as it thinks fit to act as its
representative at any meeting of Shareholders or of any class of Shareholders, and the
individual so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same rights on behalf of the Eligible
Person which he represents as that Eligible Person could exercise if it were an individual.

MYANMAR INVESTMENTS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED Page 9
7.19. The chairman of any meeting at which a vote is cast by proxy or on behalf of any Eligible

A director is deemed to be present at a meeting of directors if he participates by telephone or
other electronic means and all directors participating in the meeting are able to hear each
other.

meeting of directors held without three days’ notice having been given to all directors shall be
valid if all the directors entitled to vote at the meeting who do not attend waive notice of the
meeting, and for this purpose the presence of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver
by that director. The inadvertent failure to give notice of a meeting to a director, or the fact
that a director has not received the notice, does not invalidate the meeting.

A director may by a written instrument appoint an alternate who need not be a director and
the alternate shall be entitled to attend meetings in the absence of the director who appointed
him and to vote or consent in place of the director until the appointment lapses or is

matters as are not by the Act, the Memorandum.or the Articles required to be exercised by the
Shareholders. In lieu of minutes of a meeting the sole director shall record in writing and sign
a note or memorandum of all matters requiring a Resolution of Directors. Such a note or
memorandum constitutes sufficient evidence of such resolution for all purposes.

chairman of the meeting. If there is no Chairman of the Board or if the Chairman of the Board
is not present, the directors present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the
meeting.

An action that may be taken by the directors or a committee of directors at a meeting may
also be taken by a Resolution of Directors or a resolution of a committee of directors
consented to in writing by all directors or by all. members of the committee, as the case may
be, without the need for any notice. The consent may be in the form of counterparts each
counterpart being signed by one or more directors. If the consent is in one or more
counterparts, and the counterparts bear different dates, then the resolution shall take effect
on the date upon which the last director has consented to the resolution by signed
counterparts.

directors shall be governed mutatis mutandis by the provisions of the Articles regulating the
proceedings of directors so far as the same are not superseded by any provisions in the

Three Year Period but is no longer interested, particulars (so far as lies within his
knowledge) of the identity of the person who.had that interest immediately upon him
ceasing to hold it.

If a disclosure notice is given by the Company to a person appearing to be interested in any
Share, a copy shall at the same time be given to the holding Shareholder, but the accidental
omission to do so or the non-receipt of the copy by the Shareholder shall not prejudice the
operation of the provisions of Regulations 24.1 to 24.17

If at any time the Board is satisfied that any Shareholder, or any other person appearing to be
interested in Shares held by such Shareholder, has been duly served with a disclosure notice
and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the Company the information
thereby required, or, in purported compliance with such a notice, has made a statement which
is false or inadequate in a material particular, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at
any time thereafter by notice (a “direction notice”) to such Shareholder direct that:

(a) in respect of the Shares in relation to which the default occurred (the “Default
Shares”) the Shareholder shall not be entitled to vote at a Annual General Meeting
either personally or by proxy or to exercise any other right conferred by membership
in relation to meetings of the Company;

(b} where the Default Shares represent at least 1/4 per cent. of the total number of
Shares of the class concerned less any Shares of that class heid in treasury by the

enquiry the Shareholder is satisfied that no person in default as regards
supplying such information is interested in any of the Shares the subject of the
transfer; or

(B) the transfer is an approved transfer.

The Company shall send to each other person appearing to be interested in the Shares the

(a)

(b)

in relation to any Shares which are transferred by such Shareholder by means of an
approved transfer; or

when the Board is satisfied that such Shareholder and any other person appearing to
be interested in Shares.held by such Shareholder, has given to the Company the

Shareholder holding such Shares has given to the Company a notification which either
(i) names such person as being so interested or (il) fails to establish the identities of
all those interested in the Shares and (after taking into account any such notification
and any other relevant information) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to
believe that the person in question is or may be interested in the Shares;

the prescribed period is 28 days from the date of service of the said notice unless the
Default Shares represent at jeast 1/4 per cent. of the total number of Shares of the
class concerned less any Shares of that class held in treasury by the Company, when
the prescribed period is 14 days from that date;

(i) it is a transfer of Shares to an offer or by way or in pursuance of acceptance of
a takeover offer, meaning an offer to acquire all the Shares, or all the Shares
of any class or classes in the Company (other than Shares which at the date of
the offer are already held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are
the same in relation to all the Shares to which the offer relates or, where those
Shares include Shares of different classes, in relation to all the Shares of each
class; or

(ii) the Board is satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of the whole
of the beneficial ownership of the Shares the subject of the transfer to a party
unconnected with the Shareholder and with other persons appearing to be
interested in such Shares;

of right pursuant to the rights attached to such Share, the same restrictions shall apply to that
other Share as if it were a Default Share. Forthis purpose, Shares which the Company allots,
or procures to be offered, pro.rata (disregarding fractional entitlements) to holders of Shares
of the same class as the Default Share shall be treated as Shares allotted as of right of
existing Shares from the date on which the allotment is unconditional or, in the case of Shares
so offered, the date of the acceptance of the offer.

address and the Company will not thereafter be obliged to send to such Shareholder cheques,
warrants, notices of meetings or copies of the documents referred to in these Articles;
provided that no resolution as aforesaid shall be proposed by the Board until cheques or
warrants sent to the registered address of such Shareholder have been returned by the Post

become payable in respect of the Share in question, no cheque or warrant sent by the
Company through the post in a prepaid letter addressed to the Shareholder or to the
