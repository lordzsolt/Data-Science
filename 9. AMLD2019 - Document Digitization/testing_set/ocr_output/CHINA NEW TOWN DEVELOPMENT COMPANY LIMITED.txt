preference shareholders shall have the same rights as ordinary shareholders as regards receiving of
notices, reports and balance sheets and attending general meetings of the Company, and preference
shareholders shall also have the right to vote at any meeting convened for the purpose of winding-up
or sanctioning a sale of the undertaking or where the proposition to be submitted to the meeting
directly affects their rights and privileges or when the Distribution on the preference shares is more
than six (6) months in arrear.

(2) Subject to the Act, any preference shares may be issued or converted into shares
that, at a determinable date or at the option of the Company or, if so authorised by the
Memorandum, by the holder, are liable to be redeemed on such terms and in such manner as the
Company before the issue or conversion may by ordinary resolution of the Members determine.

(3) The Company has power to issue further preference shares ranking equally with, or
in priority to, preference shares already issued.

VARIATION OF RIGHTS

the provisions of the Statutes, preference shares other than redeemable preference shares may be
repaid and the special rights attached to any class may be varied or abrogated either with the consent
in writing of the holders of three-quarters of the total issued shares of the class or with the sanction
of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class
(but not otherwise) and may be so repaid, varied or abrogated either whilst the Company is a going
concern or during or in contemplation of a winding-up. To every such separate general meeting and
all adjournments thereof all the provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings of the
8

Company and to the proceedings thereat shall mutatis mutandis apply, except that the necessary
quorum (other than at an adjourned meeting) shall be two persons at least holding or representing
by proxy at least one-third of the total issued shares of the class and at any adjourned meeting of
such holders, two holders present in person or by proxy (whatever the number of shares held by
them) shall be a quorum and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may
demand a poll and that every such holder shall on a poll have one vote for every share of the class
held by him, provided always that where the necessary majority for such a special resolution is not
obtained at such general meeting, consent in writing if obtained from the holders of three-quarters
of the total issued shares of the class concerned within two months of such general meeting shall be
as valid and effectual as a special resolution carried at such general meeting.

11. Rights conferred upon the holders of any class of shares with preferred or other rights shall
not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such
shares, be deemed to be varied, modified or abrogated by the creation or issue of further shares
ranking pari passu therewith.

SHARES

12. (1) Subject to the Act and to the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock Exchange
(if applicable), no shares may be issued by the Board without the prior approval of the Company in
general meeting but subject thereto and to these Articles and without prejudice to any special rights
or restrictions for the time being attached to any shares or any class or series of shares, the unissued
shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may offer, allot, grant options
over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such times and for such consideration and
upon such terms and conditions as the Board may in its absolute discretion determine but so that no
shares with a par value shall be issued at a discount, provided.always that:-

(a) no shares shall be issued to transfer a controlling interest in the Company without the
prior approval of the Members in general meeting;

(b) (subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the Company in general
meeting) any issue of shares for cash to Members holding shares of any class shall
be offered to such Members in proportion as nearly as may be to the number of
shares of such class then held by them and the provisions of the second sentence of
Article 12(2) with such adaptations as are necessary shall apply; and

(c) any other issue of shares, the aggregate of which would exceed the limits referred to
in Article 12(3), shall be subject to the approval of the Company in general meeting.

Neither the Company nor the Board shall be obliged, when making or granting any allotment of,
offer of, option over or disposal of shares, to make, or make available, any such allotment, offer,
option or shares to Members or others with registered addresses in any particular territory or
territories being a territory or territories where, in the absence of a registration statement or other
special formalities, this would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable.
Members affected as a result of the foregoing sentence shall not be, or be deemed to be, a separate
class of members for any purpose whatsoever.
(2) Except as permitted under the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock
Exchange or any direction given by the Company in general meeting, all new shares shall, before
issue, be offered to such persons who as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from
the Company of general meetings in proportion, as far as the circumstances admit, to the amount
of the existing shares to which they are entitled. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the
number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed
to be declined. After the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person
to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the Board may dispose of
those shares in such manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. The Board may likewise
so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares bear to shares held
by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the Board, be conveniently
offered under this Article 12(2).

(3) Notwithstanding Article 12(2) above but subject to the Statutes and in accordance
with any applicable listing rules of the Designated Stock Exchange, the Company in general meeting
may by ordinary resolution grant to the Directors a general authority, either unconditionally or
subject to such conditions as may be-specified in the said ordinary resolution, to:-

(a) (1) issue shares of the Company (“Shares”) whether by way of rights, bonus or

otherwise; and/or

(ii) make or grant offers, agreements or options (collectively, “Instruments”)
that might or would require Shares to be issued, including but not limited to
the creation and issue of (as well as adjustments to) warrants, debentures or
other instruments convertible into Shares; and

(b) (notwithstanding the authority conferred. by the said ordinary resolution may have
ceased to be in force) issue Shares in pursuance of any Instrument made or granted
by the Directors while the said ordinary resolution was in force,

provided that:-

(aa) the aggregate number of Shares to be issued pursuant to the said ordinary resolution
(including Shares to be issued in pursuance of Instruments made or granted pursuant
to the said ordinary resolution) shall be subject to such limits and manner of
calculation as may be prescribed by the Designated Stock Exchange;

of a share a right to effect such renunciation upon and subject to such terms and conditions as the
Board considers fit to impose.

without the signature of any Director, or signed by at least one Director or such other person who
may be authorised by the Board to sign share certificates, and shall specify the number and class and
distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates, and the amount paid up thereon and

be signed by any person.

17. (1) In the case of a share held jointly by several persons, the Company shall not be bound
to issue more than one certificate therefor and delivery of a certificate to one of several joint holders
shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.

(2) Where a share stands in the names of two or more persons, the person first named in
the Register shall as regards service of notices and, subject to the provisions of these Articles, all or
any other matters connected with the Company, except the transfer of the shares, be deemed the
sole holder thereof.

(3) Where a share stands in the names of two or more persons, any request relating to

(2) The fee payable in respect of share certificates referred to in this Article and Article
19 shall be an amount not exceeding such maximum amount as the Designated Stock Exchange may
from time to time determine provided that the Board may at any time waive such fee or determine
a lower amount for such fee.

19. (1) | Upon every transfer of shares the certificate held by the transferor shall be given up
to be cancelled, and shall forthwith be cancelled accordingly, and’a new certificate shall be issued to
the transferee in respect of the shares transferred to him.

(2) | Where a Member transfers part only of the shares comprised in a certificate or where
a Member requires the Company to cancel any certificate or certificates and issue new certificates
for the purpose of subdividing his holding in a different manner the old certificate or certificates shall
be cancelled and a new certificate or.certificates for the balance of such shares issued in lieu thereof
and such Member shall pay all or any partof the stamp duty payable (if any) on each share certificate
prior to the delivery thereof which the Board in its absolute discretion may require and such fee as
is provided in Article 18(2).

(or such other period as may be approved by the Designated Stock Exchange) share certificates in
reasonable denominations for the shares so allotted or transferred.

21. Subject to the provisions of the Statutes, if any share certificate shall be defaced, worn out,
destroyed, lost or stolen, it may be renewed on such evidence being produced and a letter of
indemnity (if required) being given by the shareholder, transferee, person entitled, purchaser,
member firm or member company of the Designated Stock Exchange or on behalf of its or their
client or clients as the Directors shall require, and (in case of defacement or wearing out) on delivery
of the old certificate and in any case on payment of such sum not exceeding the maximum sum as the
Designated Stock Exchange may determine to be payable as the Directors may from time to time
require together with the amount of the stamp duty payable (if any) on each share certificate. In the
12

case of destruction, loss or theft, a shareholder or person entitled to whom such renewed certificate
is given shall also bear the loss and pay to the Company all expenses incidental to the investigations
by the Company of the evidence of such destruction or loss. Where share warrants are issued to the
bearer, no certificate thereof shall be issued to replace the one that has been lost unless the Company
is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the original certificate thereof has been destroyed.

LIEN

22. The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully paid
share) for all unpaid calls and instalments upon the share in respect of which such moneys are due
and unpaid. The Company shall also have a first and paramount lien on every share (not being a fully
paid share) registered in the name of a Member (whether or not jointly with other Members) for all
amounts of money presently payable by such Member or his estate to the Company whether the
same shall have been incurred before or after notice to the Company of any equitable or other
interest of any person other than such member, and whether the period for the payment or discharge
of the same shall have actually arrived or not, and, notwithstanding that the same are joint debts or
liabilities of such Member or his estate and any other person, whether a Member or not. The
Company's lien on a share shall extend to all Distributions.or other moneys payable thereon or in
respect thereof. The Board may at any time, generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that
has arisen or declare any share exempt in whole or in part, from the provisions of this Article.

23. (1) Subject to these~Articles, the Company may sell in such manner as the Board
determines any share on which the Company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless some sum
in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable, or the liability or engagement in respect of
which such lien exists is liable to be presently fulfilled or discharged nor until the expiration of a date
specified in a notice in writing for payment to be made, stating and demanding payment of the sum
presently payable, or specifying the liability or engagement and demanding fulfilment or discharge
thereof, has been served on the registered holder for the time being of the share or the person
entitled thereto by reason of his death or bankruptcy.

(2) The aforesaid written notice shall specify a further date not earlier than the
expiration of fourteen (14) days from the date of service of the notice on or before which the
payment required by the notice is to be made and shall contain a statement that in the event of
non-payment at or before the time named in the notice, the share will be liable to be sold.

24. The net proceeds of the sale shall be received by the Company and applied in or towards
payment or discharge of the debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists, so far as the same is
presently payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or liabilities not presently
payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the share at the
time of the sale or to his executors, administrators or assignees or as he may direct. To give effect
to any such sale the Board may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser
thereof. The purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares so transferred and he shall not
be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the shares be affected
by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale.

CALLS ON SHARES
25. Subject to these Articles and to the terms of allotment, the Board may from time to time
make calls upon the Members in respect of any moneys unpaid on their shares, and each Member
shall (subject to being given at least fourteen (14) clear days' Notice specifying the time and place
of payment) pay to the Company as required by such notice the amount called on his shares. A call
may be extended, postponed or revoked in whole or in part as the Board determines but no Member
shall be entitled to any such extension, postponement or revocation except as a matter of grace and
favour.

20. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board
authorising the call was passed and may be made payable either in one lump sum or by instalments.

27. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him
notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was made. The
joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls and instalments due in
respect thereof or other moneys due in respect thereof.

28. Ifasum called in respect.of a-share is not paid before-or on the day appointed for payment
thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day
appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per
cent. (20%) per annum) as the Board may determine, but the Board may in its absolute discretion
waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.

29. | No Member shall be entitled to receive any Distribution or bonus or to be present and vote
(save as proxy for another Member) at any general meeting either personally or by proxy, or be
reckoned in a quorum, or exercise any other privilege-as a Member until all calls or instalments due
by him to the Company, whether alone or jointly with any other person, together with interest and
expenses (if any) shall have been paid.

30. On the trial or hearing of any action or other proceedings for the recovery of any money due
for any call, it shall be sufficient to prove that the name of the Member sued is entered in the Register
as the holder, or one of the holders, of the shares in respect of which such debt accrued, that the
resolution making the call is duly recorded in the minute book, and that notice of such call was duly
given to the Member sued, in pursuance of these Articles; and it shall not be necessary to prove the
appointment of the Directors who made such call, nor any other matters whatsoever, but the proof
of the matters aforesaid shall be conclusive evidence of the debt.

31. Any amount payable in respect of a share upon allotment or at any fixed date, whether in
respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call duly
made and payable on the date fixed for payment and if it is not paid the provisions of these Articles
shall apply as if that amount had become due and payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

32. On the issue of shares the Board may differentiate between the allottees or holders as to the
amount of calls to be paid and the times of payment.

33. The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any Member willing to advance the same, and
14

either in money or money's worth, all or any part of the moneys uncalled and unpaid or instalments
payable upon any shares held by him and upon all or any of the moneys so advanced (until the same
would, but for such advance, become presently payable) pay interest at such rate (if any) as the
Board may decide. The Board may at any time repay the amount so advanced upon giving to such
Member not less than one month's Notice of its intention in that behalf, unless before the expiration
of such notice the amount so advanced shall have been called up on the shares in respect of which
it was advanced. Such payment in advance shall not entitle the holder of such share or shares to
participate in respect thereof in a Distribution subsequently declared or in profits.

FORFEITURE OF SHARES

34. (1) If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the Board may give to
the person from whom it is due a Notice:-

(a) requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have
accrued and which may still accrue up to the date of actual payment and the date for
payment to be made;

(b) specifying a further date, not earlier than the expiration of fourteen (14) days from
the date of service of the Noticeon or before which the payment required by the
Notice is to be made; and

(c) stating that in the event of non-payment at or before the time named in the Notice,
the shares on which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

(2) If the requirements of any such Notice are not complied with, any share in respect
of which such Notice has been given may-at any time thereafter, before tender of payment of all calls
and interest due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board to that
effect, and such forfeiture shall include all Distributions and bonuses declared in respect of the
forfeited share but not actually paid before the forfeiture.

35. When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be served upon the person
who was before forfeiture the holder of the share. No forfeiture shall be invalidated by any omission
or neglect to give such Notice.

36. The Board may accept the surrender of any share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in
such case, references in these Articles to forfeiture will include surrender.

37. Until cancelled in accordance with the requirements of the Act, a forfeited share shall be the
property of the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of to such person, upon
such terms and in such manner as the Board determines, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment
or disposition the forfeiture may be annulled by the Board on such terms as the Board determines.

37A.  Ifany shares are forfeited and sold, any residue after the satisfaction of the unpaid calls and
any accrued interests and expenses, shall be paid to the person whose shares have been forfeited, or
his executors, administrators or assignees or as he directs.
38. | A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a Member in respect of the
forfeited shares but nevertheless shall remain liable to pay the Company all moneys which at the date
of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of the shares, with (if the
Directors shall in their discretion so require) interest thereon from the date of forfeiture until
payment at such rate (not exceeding twenty per cent. (20%) per annum) as the Board determines.
The Board may enforce payment thereof if it thinks fit, and without any deduction or allowance for
the value of the forfeited shares, at the date of forfeiture, but his liability shall cease if and when the
Company shall have recetved payment in full of all such moneys in respect of the shares. For the
purposes of this Article any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, is payable thereon at a fixed
time which is subsequent to the date of forfeiture, whether on account of the nominal value of the
share or by way of premium, shall notwithstanding that time has not yet arrived be deemed to be
payable at the date of forfeiture, and the same shall become due and payable immediately upon the
forfeiture, but interest thereon shall only be payable in respect of any period between the said fixed
time and the date of actual payment.

39. A declaration by a Director.or the Secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified
date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated.as against all persons claiming to be
entitled to the share, and such declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer
by the Company if necessary) constitute a good title to the share, and the person to whom the share
is disposed of shall be registered as the holder of the share and shall not be bound to see to the
application of the consideration (if any), nor shall-his title to the share be affected by any irregularity
in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share. When
any share shall have been forfeited, notice of the declaration shall be given to the Member in whose
name it stood immediately prior to the forfeiture, and an entry of the forfeiture, with the date
thereof, shall forthwith be made in the Register, but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated
by any omission or neglect to give such notice or make any such entry.

40. Notwithstanding any such forfeiture as aforesaid the Board may at any time, before any
shares so forfeited shall have been sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of, permit the shares
forfeited to be bought back upon the terms of payment of all calls and interest due upon and
expenses incurred in respect of the share, and upon such further terms (if any) as it thinks fit.

Al. The forfeiture of a share shall not prejudice the right of the Company to any call already
made or instalment payable thereon. Save as otherwise provided in these Articles, the Company is
under no obligation to refund any moneys to the Member whose shares have been cancelled. Such
Member shall be discharged from any obligation to the Company to pay further calls.

42. The provisions of these Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any
sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account
of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium or otherwise, as if the same had been payable
by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

REGISTER OF MEMBERS
16

43. (1) The Company shall keep in one or more books a Register and shall enter therein
particulars required by the Act. The Company shall not be bound to register more than four (4)
persons as the holders of any shares except in the case of the legal personal representatives of a
deceased member.

(2) The Register shall be kept at the Office or at the office of the Company’s registered
agent, as may be determined by the Directors. The Company may keep an overseas or local or other
branch register of Members resident in any place, and the Board may make and vary such
regulations as it determines in respect of the keeping of any such register and maintaining a
Registration Office in connection therewith.

44. (1) A Member is entitled, on giving prior written notice to the Company, to inspect, take
copies of or take extracts from the Register including the Company’s memorandum of association
and articles of association, the register of directors and minutes of meetings and resolutions of
members and of those classes of members of which the Member is a member (collectively, for the
purpose of this Article 44, the “Documents”).. The Documents shall be open to inspection by
Members on every business day, subject to such reasonable restrictions as the Board may impose,
so that no less than two (2) hours on.every business day be allowed for inspection. The Register
including any overseas or local or other branch register of Members may, after notice has been given
in accordance with applicable requirements of any Designated Stock Exchange or by any electronic
means as may be accepted by the Designated Stock Exchange, be closed at such times or for such
periods not exceeding, in the whole, thirty (30) days in each year as the Board may determine and
either generally or in respect of any class of shares.

(2) The Board shall not refuse to permit a Member to inspect the Register, register of
directors or the minutes of meetings or resolutions of members or of those classes of members of
which the Member is a member, or any part thereof, or limit the inspection of the document,
including limiting the making of copies or the taking of extracts from the records.

(3) For the purposes of this Article 44, a “Member” shall be deemed to include a
Depositor whose name appears in the records of the Depository at the material time.

RECORD DATES

45. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, and subject to the rules of the
Designated Stock Exchange and the Act, the Company or the Directors may fix any date as the
record date for:-

(a) determining the Members entitled to receive any Distribution, allotment or issue and
such record date may be on, or at any time not more than thirty (30) days before or
after, any date on which such Distribution, allotment or issue is declared, paid or
made; and

(b) determining the Members entitled to receive notice of and to vote at any general
meeting of the Company;
17

provided that in respect of paragraph (b) above, the Directors may fix the date on which
notice is given of a general meeting, or such other date as may be specified in the notice, as the
record date for determining those Members that are entitled to vote at the general meeting.

TRANSFER OF REGISTERED SHARES

46. Subject to these Articles, any Member may transfer all or any of his shares by an instrument
of transfer in the form acceptable to the Board provided always that the Company shall accept for
registration an instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Designated Stock Exchange. The
instrument of transfer shall be sent to the Company for registration.

47. (1) The instrument of transfer of any share shall be executed by or on behalf of both the
transferor and the transferee and be witnessed, provided that where the transferee is the Depository
such instrument of transfer shall, subject to Article 47(2) below, be effective although not signed or
witnessed by or on behalf of the Depository and provided further that when a corporation executes
an instrument of transfer under seal, the affixation and attestation of the corporation’s seal may be
accepted as compliance with the requirements of this Article. The Board may also resolve, either
generally or in any particular case, upon request by either the transferor or transferee, to accept
mechanically executed transfers. The transferor shall be deemed.to remain the holder of the share
until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register.in respect thereof. The Company shall not
be required to treat a transferee of ashare as a Member until the transferee’s name has been entered
in the Register. Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Board. from recognising a renunciation
of the allotment or provisional allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person.

(2) The instrument of transfer must be signed by a transferee (including where the
transferee is the Depository) tf registration as a holder of the share imposes a liability
to the Company on the transferee:

48. (1) The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without giving any reason therefor,
pass a resolution refusing or delaying to register a transfer of any share (not being a fully paid up
share) to a person of whom it does not approve, or any share issued under any share incentive
scheme for employees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists, and it may
also, without prejudice to the foregoing generality, refuse to register a transfer of any share (not
being a fully paid up share) on which the Company has a lien or, except in the case of a transfer to
executors, administrators or trustees of the estate of a deceased Member, a transfer of any share to
more than four (4) joint holders.

(2) No transfer shall be made to an infant or to a person of unsound mind or under other
legal disability.

(3) The Board in so far as permitted by any applicable law may, in its absolute discretion,
at any time and from time to time transfer any share upon the Register to any branch register or any
share on any branch register to the Register or any other branch register. In the event of any such
transfer, the shareholder requesting such transfer shall bear the cost of effecting the transfer unless
the Board otherwise determines.
(4) Unless the Board otherwise agrees (which agreement may be on such terms and
subject to such conditions as the Board in its absolute discretion may from time to time determine,
and which agreement the Board shall, without giving any reason therefor, be entitled in its absolute
discretion to give or withhold), no shares upon the Register shall be transferred to any branch
register nor shall shares on any branch register be transferred to the Register or any other branch
register and all transfers and other documents of title shall be lodged for registration, and registered,
in the case of any shares on a branch register, at the relevant Registration Office, and, in the case of
any shares on the Register, at the Office or the office of the Company’s registered agent.

(5) Save as provided in these Articles, there shall be no restriction on the transfer of fully
paid up shares (except where required by law, or the rules or regulations of the Designated Stock
Exchange).

49. Without limiting the generality of the last preceding Article, the Board may decline to
recognise any instrument of transfer unless:-

(a) a fee of such sum (not exceeding two Singapore dollars (S$2.00) or such other
maximum sum as the Designated Stock Exchange may determine to be payable) as
the Board may from time to time require-is paid to the Company in respect thereof;

(b) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share;

(c) the instrument of transfer is lodged at the Office or the office of the Company’s
registered agent or the Registration Office (as the case may be) accompanied by the
relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably
require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument
of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that
person so to do); and

(d) if applicable, the instrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped.

50. If the Board resolves to refuse or delay the registration of a transfer of any share, it shall, as
soon as practicable send to each of the transferor and transferee notice of the refusal or delay.

51. The registration of transfers of shares or of any class of shares may, after notice has been
given in accordance with applicable requirements of the Designated Stock Exchange be suspended
at such times and for such periods as the Board may determine.

TRANSMISSION OF REGISTERED SHARES

52. In the case of the death of a Member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased Member
was a joint holder, and the legal personal representatives of the deceased Member where the
deceased Member was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having
any title to the deceased Member's interest in the shares. Nothing herein shall release the estate of
a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by such
19

deceased Member with other persons. Subject to the provisions of the Act, for the purpose of this
Article, legal personal representative means the executor or administrator of a deceased Member or
such other person as the Board may, in its absolute discretion, decide as being properly authorised
to deal with the shares of a deceased Member. Where two or more persons are registered as joint
holders of a share or shares, then in the event of the death of any joint holder or holders the
remaining joint holder or holders shall be absolutely entitled to the said share or shares and the
Company shall recognise no claim in respect of the estate of any joint holder except in the case of
the last survivor of such joint holders.

53. Any person becoming entitled by operation of law to a share in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy or winding-up of a Member may, upon such evidence as to his title being produced as
may be required by the Board, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person
nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof. If he elects to become the holder he shall
notify the Company in writing either at the Registration Office or Office, as the case may be, to that
effect. Ifhe elects to have another person registered he shall execute a transfer of the share in favour
of that person. The provisions of these Articles relating to. the transfer and registration of transfers
of shares shall apply to such notice or transfer.as.aforesaid as if the death or bankruptcy of the
Member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by such Member.

54. A person becoming entitled by operation of law to a share by reason of the death or
bankruptcy or winding-up of a Member shall be entitled to the same Distributions and other
advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share. However,
the Board may, if it thinks fit, withhold the payment of any Distribution payable or other advantages
in respect of such share until such person, shall become the registered holder of the share or shall
have effectually transferred such share, but, subject to the requirements of Article 74(2) being met,
such a person may vote at meetings.

UNTRACEABLE MEMBERS

S4A. (1) Without prejudice to the rights of the Company under paragraph (2) of this Article,
the Company may cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend warrants by post if
such cheques or warrants have been left uncashed on two consecutive occasions. However, the
Company may exercise the power to cease sending cheques for dividend entitlements or dividend
warrants after the first occasion on which such a cheque or warrant is returned undelivered.

(2) The Company shall have the power to sell, in such manner as the Board thinks fit,
any shares of a Member who is untraceable, but no such sale shall be made unless:

(a) all cheques or warrants in respect of dividends of the shares in question, being not
less than three in total number, for any sum payable in cash to the holder of such
shares in respect of them sent during the relevant period in the manner authorised by
the Articles of the Company have remained unclaimed; and

(b) the Company, if so required by the rules governing the listing of shares on the
Designated Stock Exchange, has given notice to, and caused advertisement in
newspapers in accordance with the requirements of, the Designated Stock Exchange
20

to be made of its intention to sell such shares in the manner required by the
Designated Stock Exchange, and a period of three (3) months or such shorter period
as may be allowed by the Designated Stock Exchange has elapsed since the date of
such advertisement.

For the purpose of the foregoing, the “relevant period” means the period
commencing twelve years before the date of publication of the advertisement referred to in

one Member present in person (or being a corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by
proxy shall form a quorum, for the transaction of business at any general meeting of the Company

61. — If within thirty (30) minutes (or such longer time not exceeding one hour as the chairman of
the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present,
the meeting, if convened on the requisition of Members, shall be dissolved. In any other case it shall
stand adjourned to the same day in the next week at the same time and place or to such time and
place as the Board may determine. If at such adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within half
an hour from the time appointed for holding the meeting, the meeting shall be dissolved.

meeting but it shall not be necessary to specify in such notice the nature of the business to be
transacted at the adjourned meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. Save
as aforesaid, it shall be unnecessary to give notice of an adjournment.

64. — Ifan amendment is proposed to any resolution under consideration but is in good faith ruled
out of order by the chairman of the meeting, the proceedings on the substantive resolution shall not
be invalidated by any error in such ruling. In the case of a resolution duly proposed as a special
resolution, no amendment thereto (other than a mere clerical amendment to correct a patent error)
may in any event be considered or voted upon.

65. Subject to any special rights or restrictions, as to voting for the time being attached to any
shares by or in accordance with these Articles, at.any general meeting (1) on a show of hands every

Member being a corporation, by its duly authorised representative shall have one vote for every fully
paid share of which he is the holder or which he represents and in respect of which all calls due to
the Company have been paid, but so that no amount paid up or credited as paid up on a share in
advance of calls or instalments is treated for the foregoing purposes as paid up on the share. A
resolution put to the vote of a meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless (before or on the
declaration of the result of the show of hands or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll)
a poll is demanded:-

(a) by the chairman of such meeting; or

(b) by at least three Members present in person (or in the case of a Member being a
corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy for the time being
entitled to vote at the meeting; or

(c) by a Member or Members present in person (or in the case of a Member being a
corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and representing not
less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all Members having the right to vote
at the meeting; or

(d) by a Member or Members present in person (or in the case of a Member being a
corporation by its duly authorised representative) or by proxy and holding shares in

aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid
up on all shares conferring that right; or
24

(e) where the Depository is a Member, by at least three proxies representing the
Depository.

duly authorised representative shall be deemed to be the same as a demand by a Member.

66. Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the
chairman that a resolution has been carried, or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or
not carried by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect made in the minute book of
the Company, shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion
of the votes recorded for or against the resolution.

67. Ifa poll is duly demanded the result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the
meeting at which the poll was demanded.

68. A poll demanded on the election, of a chairman, or on a question of adjournment, shall be
taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question shall be taken in such manner (including
the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) and either forthwith or at such time (being not later than
thirty (30) days after the date of the demand) and place as the chairman directs. It shall not be
necessary (unless the chairman otherwise directs) for notice to be given of a poll not taken
immediately.

69. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting or the transaction of
any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded, and, with the consent
of the chairman, it may be withdrawn at any time before the close.of the meeting or the taking of the
poll, whichever is the earlier.

70. On a poll votes may be given either personally or by proxy.

71. | A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not use all his votes or cast all the
votes he uses in the same way.

72. In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the chairman
of such meeting shall be entitled to a second or casting vote in addition to any other vote he may
have.

73. Where there are joint holders of any share, each of them may be present in person or by
proxy at a general meeting and may speak as a member. If only one of the joint holders is present in
person or by proxy, he may vote in respect of such share as if he were solely entitled thereto, but if
more than one of such joint holders be present at any meeting the vote of the senior who tenders a
vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint
holders, and for this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in
the Register in respect of the joint holding. Several executors or administrators of a deceased
Member in whose name any share stands shall for the purposes of this Article be deemed joint
holders thereof.
25

74. (1) A Member who is a patient for any purpose relating to mental health or in respect
of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction for the protection or management
of the affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs may vote, whether on a show of
hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee, curator bonis or other person in the nature of a
receiver, committee or curator bonis appointed by such court, and such receiver, committee, curator
bonis or other person may vote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and be treated as if he
were the registered holder of such shares for the purposes of general meetings, provided that such
evidence as the Board may require of the authority of the person claiming to vote shall have been
deposited at the Office, head office or Registration Office, as appropriate, not less than forty-eight
(48) hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting, or adjourned meeting or poll, as the
case may be.

(2) Any person entitled under Article 53 to be registered as the holder of any shares may
vote at any general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were the registered holder
of such shares, provided that forty-eight (48) hours at least before the time of the holding of the
meeting or adjourned meeting, as the case may be, at which he proposes to vote, he shall satisfy the
Board of his entitlement to such shares, or the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote
at such meeting in respect thereof.

75. No Member shall, unless-the Board otherwise determines, be entitled to attend and vote and
to be reckoned in a quorum at any general meeting unless he is duly registered and all calls or other
sums presently payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.

75A. Where the Company has knowledge that any Member is, under the rules of the Designated
Stock Exchange, required to abstain from voting on any particular resolution of the Company or
restricted to voting only for or only against any particular resolution of the Company, any votes cast
by or on behalf of such Member in contravention of such requirement or restriction shall not be
counted.

70. If:-
(a) any objection shall be raised to the qualification of any voter; or

(b) any votes have been counted which ought not to have been counted or which might
have been rejected; or

(c) any votes are not counted which ought to have been counted;

the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or adjourned meeting on any
resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out at the meeting or, as the case may be, the
adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to 1s given or tendered or at which the error occurs.
Any objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall only vitiate the
decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chairman decides that the same may have affected
the decision of the meeting. The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and
conclusive.

meeting provided that if the Member is the Depository or the clearing house (or its nominee(s)):-

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

the Depository of the clearing house (or its nominee(s)) may appoint proxies to
attend, speak and vote at the same general meeting and each proxy shall be entitled
to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Depository as the Depository could
exercise, including, notwithstanding Article 65, the right to vote individually on a
show of hands;

unless the Depository specifies otherwise in a written notice to the Company, the
Depository shall be deemed to have appointed as the Depository’s proxies to vote
on behalf of the Depository at a general meeting of the Company each of the
Depositors who are individuals and. whose names are shown in the records of the
Depository as at atime not earlier than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the
relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository to the Company and
notwithstanding any other provistons in-these Articles, the appointment of proxies
by virtue of this-Article 77(1)(b) shall not require an instrument of proxy or the
lodgement of any instrument of proxy;

the Company shall accept as valid in all respects the form of instrument of proxy
approved by the Depository (the “CDP Proxy Form’) for use at the date relevant to
the general meeting in question naming a Depositor (the “Nominating Depositor’’)
and permitting that Nominating Depositor,to nominate a person or persons other
than himself as the proxy or proxies appointed by the Depository. The Company
shall, in determining rights to vote and other matters in respect of a completed CDP
Proxy Form submitted to it, have regard to the instructions given by and the notes (if
any) set out in the CDP Proxy Form. The submission of any CDP Proxy Form shall
not affect the operation of Article 77(1)(b) and shall not preclude a Depositor
appointed as a proxy by virtue of Article 77(1)(b) from attending and voting at the
relevant meeting but in the event of attendance by such Depositor the CDP Proxy
Form submitted bearing his name as the Nominating Depositor shall be deemed to
be revoked;

the Company shall reject any CDP Proxy Form of a Nominating Depositor if his
name is not shown in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than
forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by
the Depository to the Company; and

on a poll the maximum number of votes which a Depositor, or proxies appointed
pursuant to a CDP Proxy Form in respect of that Depositor, is able to cast shall be
the number of shares credited to the Securities Account of that Depositor as shown
in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than forty-eight (48) hours
prior to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository to the
27

Company, whether that number is greater or smaller than the number specified in any
CDP Proxy Form or instrument of proxy executed by or on behalf of the Depository.

(2) In any case where an instrument of proxy appoints more than one proxy (including
the case when a CDP Proxy Form is used), the proportion of the shareholding concerned to be
represented by each proxy shall be specified in the instrument of proxy.

(3) A proxy need not be a Member. In addition, subject to Article 77(1), a proxy or
proxies representing either a Member who is an individual or a Member which is a corporation shall
be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Member which he or they represent as such
Member could exercise, including, notwithstanding Article 65, the right to vote individually on a
show of hands. On a poll, a proxy need not use all the votes he is entitled to cast or cast all such
votes in the same way.

78. The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or of
his attorney duly authorised in writing or, if the appointor is a corporation, either under its seal or
under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign the same or, in the case of
the Depository, signed by its duly authorised officer by some method or system of mechanical
signature as the Depository may deem appropriate. In the case of an instrument of proxy purporting
to be signed on behalf of a corporation by an officer thereof it shall be assumed, unless the contrary
appears, that such officer was duly authorised to sign such instrument of proxy on behalf of the
corporation without further evidence of the fact.

79, The instrument appointing a proxy and (if required by the Board) the power of attorney or
other authority (if any) under which it is signed on behalf of the appointor (which shall, for this
purpose, include a Depositor), or a certified copy of such power or authority, shall be delivered to
such place or one of such places (if any) as may be specified for that purpose in or by way of note
to or in any document accompanying the notice convening the meeting (or, if no place is so specified
at the Registration Office or the Office, as may be appropriate) not less than forty-eight (48) hours
before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named
in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a
meeting or adjourned meeting, not less than twenty-four (24) hours before the time appointed for
the taking of the poll and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No
instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date
named in it as the date of its execution, except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a
meeting or an adjourned meeting in cases where the meeting was originally held within twelve (12)
months from such date. Delivery of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a Member
from attending and voting in person at the meeting convened and in such event, the instrument
appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked.

80. Instruments of proxy shall be in any usual or common form (including any form approved
from time to time by the Depository) or in such other form as the Board may approve (provided that
this shall not preclude the use of the two-way form) and the Board may, if it thinks fit, send out with
28

the notice of any meeting forms of instrument of proxy for use at the meeting. The instrument of
proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any
amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The
instrument of proxy shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment
of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates.

81. A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall be valid
notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal, or revocation of the instrument of
proxy or of the authority under which it was executed, provided that no intimation in writing of such
death, insanity or revocation shall have been received by the Company at the Office or the
Registration Office (or such other place as may be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy
in the notice convening the meeting or other document sent therewith) two (2) hours at least before
the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or the taking of the poll, at which the
instrument of proxy is used.

82. Anything which under these Articles a Member may do by proxy he may likewise do by his
duly appointed attorney and the provisions of these Articles relating to proxies and instruments
appointing proxies shall apply mutatis. mutandis in relation to.any such attorney and the instrument
under which such attorney is appointed.

83. (1) Any corporation which is a Member may by resolution of its directors or other
governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of the
Company or at any meeting of any class of Members. The person so authorised shall be entitled to
exercise the same powers on behalf of such corporation as the corporation could exercise if it were
an individual Member and such corporation shall for the purposes of these Articles be deemed to be
present in person at any such meeting if a person so authorised is present thereat.

(2) Where a Member is the Depository (or its nominee, in each case, being a
corporation), it may authorise such persons as it thinks fit to act as its representatives at any meeting
of the Company or at any meeting of any class of Members provided that the authorisation shall
specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such representative is so authorised.
Each person so authorised under the provisions of this Article shall be entitled to exercise the same
rights and powers as if such person was the registered holder of the shares of the Company held by
the Depository (or its nominee) in respect of the number and class of shares specified in the relevant
authorisation including the right to vote individually on a show of hands.

(3) If the clearing house (or its nominee(s)), being a corporation, is a Member, the
clearing house or its nominee(s) (as applicable) may authorise such person(s) as it thinks fit to act
as its representative(s) at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of any class of Members
provided that, if more than one person is so authorised, the authorisation shall specify the number
and class of shares in respect of which each such representative is so authorised. Each person so
authorised under the provisions of this Article shall be deemed to have been duly authorised without
further evidence of the facts and be entitled to exercise the same rights and powers on behalf of the
clearing house (or its nominee(s)) as if such person was the registered holder of the shares of the
29

Company held by the clearing house (or its nominee(s)).

(4) Any reference in these Articles to a duly authorised representative of a Member
being a corporation shall mean a representative authorised under the provisions of this Article.

receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company shall, for the purposes
of these Articles, be treated as a resolution duly passed at a general meeting of the Company and,
where relevant, as a special resolution so passed. Any such resolution shall be deemed to have been
passed at a meeting held on the date on which it was signed by the last Member to sign, and where
the resolution states a date as being the date of his signature thereof by any Member the statement
shall be prima facie evidence that it was signed by him on that date. Such a resolution may consist

the voting rights of any class of shares of such company (or any third company
through which his interest is derived); or

50

receive such Distribution in cash in lieu of such allotment.

(4) The Board may on any occasion determine that rights of election and the allotment
of shares by way of a Distribution shall not be made available or made to any Members with
registered addresses in any territory where, in the absence of a registration statement or other

would or might, in the opinion of the Board, be unlawful or impracticable, and in such event the
provisions aforesaid shall be read and construed subject to such determination. Members affected

any purpose whatsoever.
