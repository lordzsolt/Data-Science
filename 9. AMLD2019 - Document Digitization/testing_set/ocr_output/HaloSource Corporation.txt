absolute discretion, think fit in order for any class of shares to be a participating
security (subject always to the Regulations and the facilities and requirements of the
relevant system concerned). Where they do so, articles 7.3(d) and 7.3(e) below will

these articles to continue, acting as a director; or

(ii) has not consented in writing to act as a director.
(b) The first directors are to be appointed by the Company's first registered agent.

(c) Each subsequent director will be elected by a resolution of shareholders at each annual

and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, a
director has not been elected at any annual meeting, that director may be elected by a

in the manner provided by these articles. The following will not be votes in respect of

director receives and up to the maximum number of director vacancies.

The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not
receive a majority vote will not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this article
12.3(e), an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive

article 11.12 above:

(i) a Noticing Shareholder has complied with the requirements of article 11.12
above with respect to one or more nominees; and

(ii) the Board determines that there are more candidates for election than the
number of directors to be elected. In making such determination the Board
may include the number of directors that it intends to nominate and may
exclude one or more nominees proposed by a Noticing Shareholder which it
concludes does not create a bona fide election contest.

Nothing in this article 12.3 is intended to limit the authority of the Board to change its
determination as to the existence of a Contested Election at a later date, in which
event it must disclose the applicable voting regime in the notice of meeting or if such
determination occurs after such notice has been sent issue a new notice which must
include disclosure of the applicable voting regime.

Restrictions

(a)

(b)

The Board may serve a notice in writing (a Disclosure Notice) on any person whom
the Board knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, to be interested in shares
requiring such person to indicate whether or not this is the case and, where such
person holds any interest in any such shares, to give such further information as may
be required by the Board.

    

Any Disclosure Notice ma
particulars of his, her,or i

accordance wit
and until the
accordingly.

Notwithstanding anything in t 16 to the contrary, if:
(i) a Disclosure Notice has been served on a person appearing to be interested in
Specified Shares; and

(ii) the Company has not received the information required in respect of the
Specified Shares within a period of fourteen (14) days (subject to article
16.3(f) and article 16.3(h) below) after the service of the Disclosure Notice,
then the Board may determine that the shareholder holding or who is
interested in Specified Shares is subject to the Restrictions in respect of such
shares. The Company must, as soon as practicable after the determination,
give notice to the relevant person stating that (until such time as the Board
determines otherwise under article 16.3(h) below) the Specified Shares will be
subject to the Restrictions stated in the notice.

Subject to article 16.3(c), article 16.3(f) and article 16.3(h) below, the Restrictions
which the directors determine by a resolution of directors to be applicable to Specified
Shares must be one or more (as determined by that resolution of directors) of the
following:

39
(Cc)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(i) the person holding the Specified Shares will not be entitled, in respect of the
Specified Shares, to be present or to vote (either personally, or by proxy or
otherwise) at an annual or special meeting or at a separate meeting of the
holders of a class or series of shares, or to exercise any other right in relation
to an annual or special meeting or a separate class meeting;

(ii) no transfer of the Specified Shares will be effective or will be recognised by the
Company; and

(iii) no dividend or other sums which would otherwise be payable on or in respect
of the Specified Shares are to be paid to the person holding the Specified
Shares and, in circumstances where an offer of the right to elect to receive
shares instead of cash in respect of a dividend is or has been made, an
election made in respect of the Specified Shares will not be effective.

The Board may determine that one or more Restrictions imposed on Specified Shares
will cease to apply at any time. If the Company receives the information required in
the relevant Disclosure Notice, the Board must, within seven (7) days of receipt,
determine that all Restrictions ana on the Specified Shares will cease to apply. In
addition, the Board mu Sty leterm all Restrictions imposed on the Specified

     
   
 

Where dividends or other’sum e On) Specified Shares are not paid as a result of
Restrictions having been impo ie dividends or other sums will accrue and be
payable (without interest) on the relevant Restrictions ceasing to apply.

If the Board makes a determination under article 16.3(c) above, it must notify the
purported transferee as soon as practicable and any person may make representations
in writing to the Board concerning the determination. Neither the Company nor the
Board will in any event be liable to any person as a result of the Board having imposed
Restrictions, or failed to determine that Restrictions will cease to apply, if the Board
has acted in good faith.

Where the Specified Shares represent less than one-quarter of one per cent (0.25%)
of the issued and outstanding shares or shares of the same class as the Specified
Shares in issue at the date of issue of the relevant Disclosure Notice, then:

(i) the period of fourteen (14) days referred to in article 16.3(a)(ii) above is to be
treated as a reference to a period of twenty-eight (28) days; and

(ii) any determination made by the Board under article 16.3(c) above may only
impose the Restrictions referred to in article 16.3(b)(i) above.

(b)

(Cc)

Shares issued in respect of Specified Shares that are at the relevant time subject to
particular Restrictions will, on issue, become subject to the same Restrictions as the
relevant Specified Shares. For this purpose, shares which the Company procures to be
offered to shareholders pro rata (or pro rata ignoring fractional entitlements and
shares not offered to certain shareholders by reason of legal or practical problems
associated with offering shares outside the United Kingdom) will be treated as shares
issued in respect of Specified Shares.

The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion, suspend, in whole or in part, the
imposition of a Restriction, either permanently or for a given period, and may pay a
dividend or other sums payable in respect of the Specified Shares to a trustee (subject
to the Restriction referred to in article 16.3(b)(iii) above). Notice of suspension,
specifying the Restrictions suspended and the period of suspension, must be given by
the Company to the relevant shareholder as soon as practicable.

Where a Disclosure Notice is served on an Operator, the obligations of the Operator
will be limited to disclosing information recorded by it relating to a person appearing to
be interested in the shares held by it.

(iv) be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction
with, or otherwise interested in, any subsidiary of the Company or any body

created by it, accountable to the Company for any remuneration, profit or other
benefit derived, or resulting, from any interest permitted by paragraph (a) above.

No transaction permitted by paragraph (a) above is liable to be avoided on the

grounds that a director has an interest in it or derives any remuneration, profit or
other benefit from it.

TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

 

Offer
(a) When:

(i) any person acquires, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time
or not, beneficial ownership of securities that (taken together with securities
held or acquired by persons acting in concert with such person) represent
thirty per cent (30%) or more of the Voting Rights; or

(ii) any person, together with persons acting in concert with such person, holds
beneficial ownership of securities representing not less than thirty per cent
(30%) but not more than fifty per cent (50%) of the Voting Rights and such
person, or any person acting in concert with such person, acquires additional
securities that will increase his, her or its percentage of the Voting Rights,

then such person and any person acting in concert with such person (each such person
referred to herein as the Offeror) must extend an Offer, on the basis set out in
articles 19.1(c) to 19.2(b) below, to the holders of all the issued and outstanding
shares. Offers for different classes of shares (if any) must be comparable.

45
19.2

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

The taking of an option to acquire shares will be deemed to constitute the acquisition
of shares giving rise to the obligation to make an Offer under article 19.1(a) above
where the relationship and arrangements between the parties concerned are such that
effective Control has passed to the taker of the option. The acquisition of Voting
Rights, or general Control of them, as distinct from the associated shares, itself will be
deemed to be an acquisition of the associated shares.

Each member of a group of persons acting in concert that constitutes an Offeror will
have a joint and several obligation to extend an Offer.

In respect of any Offer(s) made under article 19.1(a) above:

(i) such Offer(s) must be conditional only upon the Offeror having received
acceptances in respect of securities which, together with shares acquired or
agreed to be acquired before or during the Offer, will result in the Offeror, and
any person acting in concert with him, her or it, holding securities representing
more than fifty per cent (50%) of the Voting Rights; and

(ii) no acquisition of se

(Cc)

(d)

When shares have been acquired for consideration other than cash in a transaction
giving rise to an obligation to make an Offer under article 19.1(a) above, the Offer
must nevertheless be in cash or be accompanied by a cash alternative of at least equal
value, which value must be determined by an independent valuation.

In calculating the price paid for shares, stamp duty and broker's commission, if any,
will be excluded.

If shares have been acquired in exchange for listed securities in a transaction giving
rise to an obligation to make an Offer under article 19.1(a) above, the price paid for
such shares will be established by reference to the middle market price of such listed
securities on the applicable market on the date of such acquisition.

If shares are admitted to trading on AIM and have been acquired by the conversion or

exercise (as applicable) of convertible securities, warrants, options or other
subscription rights, the price paid for such shares will normally be established by

46
19.3

19.4

19.5

19.6

reference to the middle market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange at
the close of business on the day on which the relevant exercise or conversion notice
was. submitted. If, however, the convertible securities, warrants, options or
subscription rights were acquired during the Offer Period or within twelve (12) months
prior to its commencement, they will be treated as if they were purchases of the
underlying shares at a price equal to the sum of the purchase price of such convertible
securities, warrants, options or subscription rights plus the relevant conversion or
exercise price paid (or, if such convertible securities, warrants, options or subscription
rights have not yet been converted or exercised, the maximum conversion or exercise
price payable under the relevant conversion or exercise terms).

Sale by a director

In the event that any director (or any of his or her affiliates) sells shares to a purchaser as a
result of which the purchaser is required to make an Offer under article 19.1(b) above, such
director must ensure that as a condition of the sale the purchaser undertakes to fulfill its
obligations under article 19.1(a) above. In addition, subject to article 19.7 below, such
director must not resign from the Board until the first closing date of the Offer or the date
when the Offer becomes or is declared wholly unconditional, whichever is the later.

(b) if an issue of New Securities by the Company as consideration for an acquisition or a
cash subscription would otherwise result in an obligation to make an Offer under
article 19.1(b) above, the obligation may be waived with the consent of the holders of
a majority of the Voting Rights of those persons who are neither the proposed issue of
the New Securities nor affiliated or acting in concert with the proposed issue(s) of such
New Securities; or

(Cc) if an underwriter incurs an obligation under article 19.1(b) above unexpectedly (e.g.,
as a result of an inability to complete a distribution of securities of the Company), the
obligation may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority of the Voting
Rights of those persons who are neither the underwriter(s) nor affiliated or acting in
concert with such underwriter(s).

Offeror's failure to comply
If an Offeror fails to comply with article 19.1(a) and article 19.1(d) through article 19.2(b)

above, or fails to comply with such Offeror's obligations under the Offer, and persists in such
failure after written notice from the Company to such person(s), the Board may:

discretion of the Board, and will be waived when:

the shares subject to such restrictions are proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Board to have been sold to a new beneficial owner that is not affiliated or acting in
concert with the Offeror;

   
  

Indemnity

(a)

(b)

Subject to the Act and these articles, the Company is to indemnify any person (an
Indemnitee) who:

(i) is Or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened,
pending or completed proceedings (Proceedings), whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that the person is or was
a director; or

(ii) is or was, at the request of the Company, serving as a director of, or in any
other capacity is or was acting for, another body corporate or a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

against any expenses, judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement and reasonably
incurred in connection with any legal, administrative or investigative proceedings.

Subject to the Act, the Company may, in relation to any Indemnitee:

(i) pay on behalf of that Indemnitee: or

48
20.2

(ii) lend funds to that Indemnitee to enable that Indemnitee to pay,

any expenses (Expenses) incurred, or to be incurred, by that Indemnitee in defending
any legal, administrative or investigative proceedings.

Procedure for seeking indemnification and/or advancement of expenses

(a) An Indemnitee must promptly notify the Company in writing of any Proceedings for
which indemnification could be sought under article 20.1 above. In addition, an
Indemnitee must give the Company such information and cooperation as it may
reasonably require as is within the Indemnitee's power.

(b) With respect to any Proceedings of which an Indemnitee has notified the Company:
(i) the Company will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; and
(ii) except as otherwise provided below, to the extent that it may wish, the

Company, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, will be
entitled to assume the»de thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the
Indemnitee. The ‘consent to such counsel may not be

Proceeding,

the Expenses relating to the Indemnitee's counsel will be at the expense of the
Company.

(d) The Company will not be entitled to assume the defence of Proceedings brought by or
on behalf of the Company or as to which the Indemnitee has reasonably made the
conclusion that a conflict of interest may exist between the Company and the
Indemnitee in the conduct of the defence.

(e) For the purpose of pursuing a right to be indemnified under article 20.1 above, an
Indemnitee must submit to the Board a sworn statement requesting indemnification
along with reasonable evidence of all amounts for which such indemnification is
requested (together, an Indemnification Statement). Submission of an
Indemnification Statement to the Board will create a presumption that the Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification under article 20.1 above, and the Company must, within
sixty (60) calendar days thereafter, make the payments requested in the
Indemnification statement to or for the benefit of the Indemnitee, unless:

(i) within such sixty (60) calendar day period the Company determines that the
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under article 20.1 above;

(ii) such determination is made on the basis of clear and convincing evidence
(sufficient to rebut the foregoing presumption); and

(iii) the Indemnitee receives notice in writing of such determination, which notice
must disclose with particularity the evidence upon which the determination is
based.

Any determination that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, and any
failure to make the payments requested in the Indemnification Statement, will be
subject to judicial review by any court of competent jurisdiction.

An Indemnitee seeking payment of Expenses in advance of a final disposition of
