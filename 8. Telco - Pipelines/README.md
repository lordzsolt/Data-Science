# Telco - Pipelines

I had the chance to attend the PyData Warsaw 2018 Conference, where I learned about [sklearn.pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.pipeline) and how it can solve the fragility of reproducible results that come with Jupyter notebooks. I decided to reimplement my first project with the use of Pipelines.
